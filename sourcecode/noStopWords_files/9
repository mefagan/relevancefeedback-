Its main figures Jimmy Wales, CEO Bomis, Larry Sanger, editor-in-chief Nupedia later Wikipedia. Nupedia licensed initially Nupedia Open Content License, switching GNU Free Documentation License Wikipedia's founding urging Richard Stallman.[23] Sanger Wales founded Wikipedia.[24][25] While Wales credited defining goal making publicly editable encyclopedia,[26][27] Sanger credited strategy using wiki reach goal.[28] On January 10, 2001, Sanger proposed Nupedia mailing list create wiki "feeder" project Nupedia.[29] Play media Wikipedia according Simpleshow External audio The Great Book Knowledge, Part 1, Ideas Paul Kennedy, CBC, January 15, 2014 Launch early growth Wikipedia launched January 15, 2001, single English-language edition www.wikipedia.com,[30] announced Sanger Nupedia mailing list.[26] Wikipedia's policy "neutral point-of-view"[31] codified first months. Otherwise, relatively rules initially Wikipedia operated independently Nupedia.[26] Originally, Bomis intended make Wikipedia business profit.[32] Wikipedia gained early contributors Nupedia, Slashdot postings, web search engine indexing. By August 8, 2001, Wikipedia 8,000 articles.[33] On September 25, 2001, Wikipedia 13,000 articles.[34] By end 2001, grown approximately 20,000 articles 18 language editions. It reached 26 language editions late 2002, 46 end 2003, 161 final days 2004.[35] Nupedia Wikipedia coexisted former's servers taken permanently 2003, text incorporated Wikipedia. The English Wikipedia passed mark two million articles September 9, 2007, making largest encyclopedia ever assembled, surpassing even 1408 Yongle Encyclopedia, held record almost 600years.[36] Citing fears commercial advertising lack control Wikipedia, users Spanish Wikipedia forked Wikipedia create Enciclopedia Libre February 2002.[37] These moves encouraged Wales announce Wikipedia would display advertisements, change Wikipedia's domain wikipedia.com wikipedia.org.[38] Though English Wikipedia reached three million articles August 2009, growth edition, terms numbers articles contributors, appears peaked around early 2007.[39] Around 1,800 articles added daily encyclopedia 2006; 2013 average roughly 800.[40] A team Palo Alto Research Center attributed slowing growth project's increasing exclusivity resistance change.[41] Others suggest growth flattening naturally articles could called "low-hanging fruit"—topics clearly merit article—have already created built extensively.[42][43][44] In November 2009, researcher Rey Juan Carlos University Madrid (Spain) found English Wikipedia lost 49,000 editors first three months 2009; comparison, project lost 4,900 editors period 2008.[45][46] The Wall Street Journal cited array rules applied editing disputes related content among reasons trend.[47] Wales disputed claims 2009, denying decline questioning methodology study.[48] Two years later, 2011, Wales acknowledged presence slight decline, noting decrease "a little 36,000 writers" June 2010 35,800 June 2011. In interview, Wales also claimed number editors "stable sustainable".[49] A 2013 article titled "The Decline Wikipedia" MIT's Technology Review questioned claim. The article revealed since 2007, Wikipedia lost third volunteer editors update correct online encyclopedia still focused increasingly minutiae.[50] In July 2012, Atlantic reported number administrators also decline.[51] In November 25, 2013, issue New York magazine, Katherine Ward stated "Wikipedia, sixth-most-used website, facing internal crisis".[52] Wikipedia blackout protest SOPA January 18, 2012 Play media A promotional video Wikimedia Foundation encourages viewers edit Wikipedia, mostly reviewing 2014 via Wikipedia content Milestones In January 2007, Wikipedia entered first time top-ten list popular websites U.S., according comScore Networks. With 42.9 million unique visitors, Wikipedia ranked number 9, surpassing New York Times (#10) Apple (#11). This marked significant increase January 2006, rank number 33, Wikipedia receiving around 18.3 million unique visitors.[53] As March 2015[update], Wikipedia rank 5[7][54] among websites terms popularity according Alexa Internet. In 2014, received 8 billion pageviews every month.[55] On February 9, 2014, The New York Times reported Wikipedia 18 billion page views nearly 500 million unique visitors month, "according ratings firm comScore."[16] On January 18, 2012, English Wikipedia participated series coordinated protests two proposed laws United States Congress—the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) PROTECT IP Act (PIPA)—by blacking pages 24 hours.[56] More 162 million people viewed blackout explanation page temporarily replaced Wikipedia content.[57][58] Loveland Reagle argue that, process, Wikipedia follows long tradition historical encyclopedias accumulated improvements piecemeal "stigmergic accumulation".[59][60] On January 20, 2014, Subodh Varma reporting The Economic Times indicated Wikipedia's growth flattened "lost nearly 10 per cent page-views last year. That's decline 2 billion December 2012 December 2013. Its popular versions leading slide: page-views English Wikipedia declined 12 per cent, German version slid 17 per cent Japanese version lost 9 per cent."[61] Varma added that, "While Wikipedia's managers think could due errors counting, experts feel Google's Knowledge Graphs project launched last year may gobbling Wikipedia users."[61] When contacted matter, Clay Shirky, associate professor New York University fellow Harvard's Berkman Center Internet Security indicated suspected much page view decline due Knowledge Graphs, stating, "If get question answered search page, don't need click [any further]."[61] By end December 2016, Wikipedia ranked fifth popular websites globally.[62] Number Wikipedia articles[63] Wikipedia editors 100 edits per month[63] Openness Differences versions article highlighted shown Unlike traditional encyclopedias, Wikipedia follows procrastination principle[notes 5][64] regarding security content.[64] It started almost entirely open—anyone could create articles, Wikipedia article could edited reader, even Wikipedia account. Modifications articles would published immediately. As result, article could contain inaccuracies errors, ideological biases, nonsensical irrelevant text. Restrictions Due increasing popularity Wikipedia, popular editions, including English version, introduced editing restrictions cases. For instance, English Wikipedia language editions, registered users may create new article.[65] On English Wikipedia, among others, particularly controversial, sensitive and/or vandalism-prone pages protected degree.[66][67] A frequently vandalized article semi-protected extended confirmed protected, meaning autoconfirmed extended confirmed editors able modify it.[68] A particularly contentious article may locked administrators able make changes.[69] In certain cases, editors allowed submit modifications, review required editors, depending certain conditions. For example, German Wikipedia maintains "stable versions" articles,[70] passed certain reviews. Following protracted trials community discussion, English Wikipedia introduced "pending changes" system December 2012.[71] Under system, new unregistered users' edits certain controversial vandalism-prone articles reviewed established users published.[72] The editing interface Wikipedia Review changes Although changes systematically reviewed, software powers Wikipedia provides certain tools allowing anyone review changes made others. The "History" page article links revision.[notes 6][73] On articles, anyone undo others' changes clicking link article's history page. Anyone view latest changes articles, anyone may maintain "watchlist" articles interest notified changes. "New pages patrol" process whereby newly created articles checked obvious problems.[74] In 2003, economics PhD student Andrea Ciffolilli argued low transaction costs participating wiki create catalyst collaborative development, features allowing easy access past versions page favor "creative construction" "creative destruction".[75] Vandalism Main article: Vandalism Wikipedia Any change edit manipulates content way purposefully compromises integrity Wikipedia considered vandalism. The common obvious types vandalism include additions obscenities crude humor. Vandalism also include advertising types spam.[76] Sometimes editors commit vandalism removing content entirely blanking given page. Less common types vandalism, deliberate addition plausible false information article, difficult detect. Vandals introduce irrelevant formatting, modify page semantics page's title categorization, manipulate underlying code article, use images disruptively.[77] American journalist John Seigenthaler (1927–2014), subject Seigenthaler incident Obvious vandalism generally easy remove Wikipedia articles; median time detect fix vandalism minutes.[78][79] However, vandalism takes much longer repair.[80] In Seigenthaler biography incident, anonymous editor introduced false information biography American political figure John Seigenthaler May 2005. Seigenthaler falsely presented suspect assassination John F. Kennedy.[80] The article remained uncorrected four months.[80] Seigenthaler, founding editorial director USA Today founder Freedom Forum First Amendment Center Vanderbilt University, called Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales asked whether way knowing contributed misinformation. Wales replied not, although perpetrator eventually traced.[81][82] After incident, Seigenthaler described Wikipedia "a flawed irresponsible research tool".[80] This incident led policy changes Wikipedia, specifically targeted tightening verifiability biographical articles living people.[83] Policies laws See also: Wikipedia:Five Pillars External video Wikimania, 60 Minutes, CBS, 20 minutes, April 5, 2015, co-founder Jimmy Wales Fosdem Content Wikipedia subject laws (in particular, copyright laws) United States U.S. state Virginia, majority Wikipedia's servers located. Beyond legal matters, editorial principles Wikipedia embodied "five pillars" numerous policies guidelines intended appropriately shape content. Even rules stored wiki form, Wikipedia editors write revise website's policies guidelines.[84] Editors enforce rules deleting modifying non-compliant material. Originally, rules non-English editions Wikipedia based translation rules English Wikipedia. They since diverged extent.[70] Content policies guidelines According rules English Wikipedia, entry Wikipedia must topic encyclopedic dictionary entry dictionary-like.[85] A topic also meet Wikipedia's standards "notability",[86] generally means topic must covered mainstream media major academic journal sources independent article's subject. Further, Wikipedia intends convey knowledge already established recognized.[87] It must present original research. A claim likely challenged requires reference reliable source. Among Wikipedia editors, often phrased "verifiability, truth" express idea readers, encyclopedia, ultimately responsible checking truthfulness articles making interpretations.[88] This times lead removal information valid.[89] Finally, Wikipedia must take sides.[90] All opinions viewpoints, attributable external sources, must enjoy appropriate share coverage within article.[91] This known neutral point view (NPOV). Governance Further information: Wikipedia:Administration Wikipedia's initial anarchy integrated democratic hierarchical elements time.[92][93] An article considered owned creator editor vetted recognized authority.[94] Wikipedia's contributors avoid tragedy commons internalizing benefits. They experiencing flow identifying gaining status Wikipedia community.[95] Administrators Editors good standing community run one many levels volunteer stewardship: begins "administrator",[96][97] privileged users delete pages, prevent articles changed case vandalism editorial disputes, try prevent certain persons editing. Despite name, administrators supposed enjoy special privilege decision-making; instead, powers mostly limited making edits project-wide effects thus disallowed ordinary editors, implement restrictions intended prevent certain persons making disruptive edits (such vandalism).[98][99] Fewer editors become administrators years past, part process vetting potential Wikipedia administrators become rigorous.[100] Bureaucrats name new administrators, solely upon recommendations community. Dispute resolution Wikipedians often disputes regarding content, may result repeatedly making opposite changes article, known edit warring[101][102] Over time, Wikipedia developed semi-formal dispute resolution process assist circumstances. In order determine community consensus, editors raise issues appropriate community forums,[notes 7] seek outside input third opinion requests initiating general community discussion known request comment. Arbitration Committee Main article: Arbitration Committee The Arbitration Committee presides ultimate dispute resolution process. Although disputes usually arise disagreement two opposing views article read, Arbitration Committee explicitly refuses directly rule specific view adopted. Statistical analyses suggest committee ignores content disputes rather focuses way disputes conducted,[103] functioning much resolve disputes make peace conflicting editors, weed problematic editors allowing potentially productive editors back participate. Therefore, committee dictate content articles, although sometimes condemns content changes deems new content violates Wikipedia policies (for example, new content considered biased). Its remedies include cautions probations (used 63% cases) banning editors articles (43%), subject matters (23%) Wikipedia (16%). Complete bans Wikipedia generally limited instances impersonation anti-social behavior. When conduct impersonation anti-social, rather anti-consensus violation editing policies, remedies tend limited warnings.[104] Community Main article: Wikipedia community Play media Video Wikimania 2005 – annual conference users Wikipedia projects operated Wikimedia Foundation, held Frankfurt Main, Germany August 4 8. Each article user Wikipedia associated "Talk" page. These form primary communication channel editors discuss, coordinate debate.[105] Play media Wikipedians British Museum curators collaborate article Hoxne Hoard June 2010 Wikipedia's community described cult-like,[106] although always entirely negative connotations.[107] The project's preference cohesiveness, even requires compromise includes disregard credentials, referred "anti-elitism".[108] Wikipedians sometimes award one another virtual barnstars good work. These personalized tokens appreciation reveal wide range valued work extending far beyond simple editing include social support, administrative actions, types articulation work.[109] Wikipedia require editors contributors provide identification.[110] As Wikipedia grew, "Who writes Wikipedia?" became one questions frequently asked project.[111] Jimmy Wales argued "a community... dedicated group hundred volunteers" makes bulk contributions Wikipedia project therefore "much like traditional organization".[112] In 2008, Slate magazine article reported that: "According researchers Palo Alto, 1 percent Wikipedia users responsible half site's edits."[113] This method evaluating contributions later disputed Aaron Swartz, noted several articles sampled large portions content (measured number characters) contributed users low edit counts.[114] The English Wikipedia 5,380,909 articles, 30,671,748 registered editors, 138,829 active editors. An editor considered active made one edits past thirty days. Editors fail comply Wikipedia cultural rituals, signing talk page comments, may implicitly signal Wikipedia outsiders, increasing odds Wikipedia insiders may target discount contributions. Becoming Wikipedia insider involves non-trivial costs: contributor expected learn Wikipedia-specific technological codes, submit sometimes convoluted dispute resolution process, learn "baffling culture rich in-jokes insider references".[115] Editors log sense second-class citizens Wikipedia,[115] "participants accredited members wiki community, vested interest preserving quality work product, basis ongoing participation",[116] contribution histories anonymous unregistered editors recognized IP addresses cannot attributed particular editor certainty. A 2007 study researchers Dartmouth College found "anonymous infrequent contributors Wikipedia […] reliable source knowledge contributors register site".[117] Jimmy Wales stated 2009 "(I)t turns 50% edits done .7% users... 524 people... And fact active 2%, 1400 people, done 73.4% edits."[112] However, Business Insider editor journalist Henry Blodget showed 2009 random sample articles, content Wikipedia (measured amount contributed text survives latest sampled edit) created "outsiders", editing formatting done "insiders".[112] A 2008 study found Wikipedians less agreeable, open, conscientious others,[118][119] although later commentary pointed serious flaws, including data showed higher openness, differences control group small samples.[120] According 2009 study, "evidence growing resistance Wikipedia community new content".[121] Diversity Wikipedia editor demographics (2008) One study found contributor base Wikipedia "was barely 13% women; average age contributor mid-20s".[122] A 2011 study researchers University Minnesota found females comprised 16.1% 38,497 editors started editing Wikipedia 2009.[123] In January 2011 New York Times article, Noam Cohen observed 13% Wikipedia's contributors female according 2008 Wikimedia Foundation survey.[124] Sue Gardner, former executive director Wikimedia Foundation, hoped see female contributions increase 25% 2015.[125] Linda Basch, president National Council Research Women, noted contrast Wikipedia editor statistics percentage women currently completing bachelor's degrees, master's degrees PhD programs United States (all rates 50 percent greater).[126] In response, various universities hosted edit-a-thons encourage women participate Wikipedia community. In fall 2013, 15 colleges universities — including Yale, Brown, Pennsylvania State — offered college credit students "write feminist thinking" technology Wikipedia.[127] Estimates diversity contributors educational level indicated sixty-two percent Wikipedia's editors high school undergraduate college level education.[128] In August 2014, Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales said BBC interview Wikimedia Foundation "... really doubling efforts ..." reach 25% female editors (originally targeted 2015), since Foundation "totally failed" far. Wales said "a lot things need happen ... lot outreach, lot software changes".[129] Andrew Lih, writing The New York Times, quoted Bloomberg News December 2016 supporting Wales comments concerning shortfalls Wikipedia's outreach female editors. Lih states concern question indicating that: "How get people participate (editing) environment feels unsafe, identifying woman, feminist, could open ugly, intimidating behavior".[130] Language editions Parts article (those related https://stats.wikimedia.org/wikimedia/squids/SquidReportPageEditsPerCountryBreakdown.htm) need updated. Please update article reflect recent events newly available information. (March 2017) There currently 295 language editions Wikipedia (also called language versions, simply Wikipedias). Thirteen one million articles (English, Swedish, Cebuano, German, Dutch, French, Russian, Italian, Spanish, Waray-Waray, Polish, Vietnamese Japanese), five 500,000 articles (Portuguese, Chinese, Ukrainian, Catalan Persian), 40 100,000 articles, 77 10,000articles.[131][132] The largest, English Wikipedia, 5.3 million articles. As January 2017[update], according Alexa, English subdomain (en.wikipedia.org; English Wikipedia) receives approximately 55% Wikipedia's cumulative traffic, remaining split among languages (Russian: 9%; Japanese: 7%; Spanish: 6%; French: 4%).[7] As April 2017, six largest language editions (in order article count) English, Cebuano, Swedish, German, Dutch, French Wikipedias.[133] Distribution 44,160,825 articles different language editions (as 10 April 2017)[134] English (12.2%) Cebuano (9.4%) Swedish (8.6%) German (4.6%) Dutch (4.3%) French (4.2%) Russian (3.1%) Italian (3%) Spanish (3%) Waray (2.9%) Polish (2.8%) Vietnamese (2.6%) Japanese (2.4%) Portuguese (2.2%) Other (34.7%) Logarithmic graph 20 largest language editions Wikipedia (as 10 April 2017)[135] (millions articles) 0.1 0.3 1 3 English 5,380,909 Cebuano 4,138,135 Swedish 3,785,049 German 2,048,714 Dutch 1,897,908 French 1,858,259 Russian 1,384,908 Italian 1,346,331 Spanish 1,327,066 Waray 1,262,379 Polish 1,215,642 Vietnamese 1,155,136 Japanese 1,055,534 Portuguese 964,262 Chinese 934,268 Ukrainian 688,922 Catalan 538,744 Persian 526,845 Arabic 513,311 Norwegian 464,789 The unit numbers bars articles. Since Wikipedia based Web therefore worldwide, contributors language edition may use different dialects may come different countries (as case English edition). These differences may lead conflicts spelling differences (e.g. colour versus color)[136] points view.[137] Though various language editions held global policies "neutral point view", diverge points policy practice, notably whether images licensed freely may used claim fair use.[138][139][140] Jimmy Wales described Wikipedia "an effort create distribute free encyclopedia highest possible quality every single person planet language".[141] Though language edition functions less independently, efforts made supervise all. They coordinated part Meta-Wiki, Wikimedia Foundation's wiki devoted maintaining projects (Wikipedia others).[142] For instance, Meta-Wiki provides important statistics language editions Wikipedia,[143] maintains list articles every Wikipedia have.[144] The list concerns basic content subject: biography, history, geography, society, culture, science, technology, mathematics. As rest, rare articles strongly related particular language counterparts another edition. For example, articles small towns United States might available English, even meet notability criteria language Wikipedia projects. Estimation contributions shares different regions world different Wikipedia editions Translated articles represent small portion articles editions, part fully automated translation articles disallowed.[145] Articles available one language may offer "interwiki links", link counterpart articles editions. A study published PLOS ONE 2012 also estimated share contributions different editions Wikipedia different regions world. It reported proportion edits made North America 51% English Wikipedia, 25% simple English Wikipedia.[146] The Wikimedia Foundation hopes increase number editors Global South thirty-seven percent 2015.[147] On March 1, 2014, The Economist article titled "The Future Wikipedia" cited trend analysis concerning data published Wikimedia stating that: "The number editors English-language version fallen third seven years."[148] The attrition rate active editors English Wikipedia cited The Economist substantially contrast statistics Wikipedia languages (non-English Wikipedia). The Economist reported number contributors average five edits per month relatively constant since 2008 Wikipedia languages approximately 42,000 editors within narrow seasonal variances 2,000 editors down.

At quoted trend rate, number active editors English Wikipedia lost approximately 20,000 editors attrition since 2007, documented trend rate indicates loss another 20,000 editors 2021, 10,000 active editors English Wikipedia 2021 left unabated.[148] Given trend analysis published The Economist presents number active editors Wikipedia languages (non-English Wikipedia) remaining relatively constant successful sustaining numbers approximately 42,000 active editors, contrast pointed effectiveness Wikipedia languages retain active editors renewable sustained basis.[148] No comment made concerning differentiated edit policy standards Wikipedia languages (non-English Wikipedia) would provide possible alternative English Wikipedia effectively ameliorating substantial editor attrition rates English language Wikipedia.[149] Critical reception See also: Academic studies Wikipedia Criticism Wikipedia Several Wikipedians criticized Wikipedia's large growing regulation, includes 50 policies nearly 150,000 words 2014[update].[150][151] Critics stated Wikipedia exhibits systemic bias. Columnist journalist Edwin Black criticizes Wikipedia mixture "truth, half truth, falsehoods".[20] Articles The Chronicle Higher Education The Journal Academic Librarianship criticized Wikipedia's Undue Weight policy, concluding fact Wikipedia explicitly designed provide correct information subject, rather focus major viewpoints subject give less attention minor ones, creates omissions lead false beliefs based incomplete information.[152][153][154] Journalists Oliver Kamm Edwin Black noted articles dominated loudest persistent voices, usually group "ax grind" topic.[20][155] An article Education Next Journal concluded resource controversial topics, Wikipedia notoriously subject manipulation spin.[21] In 2006, Wikipedia Watch criticism website listed dozens examples plagiarism English Wikipedia.[156] Accuracy content Main article: Reliability Wikipedia Articles traditional encyclopedias Encyclopædia Britannica carefully deliberately written experts, lending encyclopedias reputation accuracy.[157] Conversely, Wikipedia often cited factual inaccuracies misrepresentations. However, peer review 2005 forty-two scientific entries Wikipedia Encyclopædia Britannica science journal Nature found differences accuracy, concluded "the average science entry Wikipedia contained around four inaccuracies; Britannica, three."[19] Reagle suggested study reflects "a topical strength Wikipedia contributors" science articles, "Wikipedia may fared well using random sampling articles humanities subjects."[158] The findings Nature disputed Encyclopædia Britannica,[159][160] response, Nature gave rebuttal points raised Britannica.[161] In addition point-for-point disagreement two parties, others examined sample size selection method used Nature effort, suggested "flawed study design" (in Nature's manual selection articles, part whole, comparison), absence statistical analysis (e.g., reported confidence intervals), lack study "statistical power" (i.e., owing small sample size, 42 4 x 101 articles compared, vs 105 106 set sizes Britannica English Wikipedia, respectively).[162] As consequence open structure, Wikipedia "makes guarantee validity" content, since one ultimately responsible claims appearing it.[163] Concerns raised PC World 2009 regarding lack accountability results users' anonymity,[164] insertion false information,[165] vandalism, similar problems. Economist Tyler Cowen wrote: "If I guess whether Wikipedia median refereed journal article economics likely true, long think I would opt Wikipedia." He comments traditional sources non-fiction suffer systemic biases novel results, opinion, over-reported journal articles relevant information omitted news reports. However, also cautions errors frequently found Internet sites, academics experts must vigilant correcting them.[166] Critics argue Wikipedia's open nature lack proper sources information makes unreliable.[167] Some commentators suggest Wikipedia may reliable, reliability given article clear.[168] Editors traditional reference works Encyclopædia Britannica questioned project's utility status encyclopedia.[169] External video Inside Wikipedia – Attack PR Industry, Deutsche Welle, 7:13 mins[170] Wikipedia's open structure inherently makes easy target Internet trolls, spammers, various forms paid advocacy seen counterproductive maintenance neutral verifiable online encyclopedia.[73][171] In response paid advocacy editing undisclosed editing issues, Wikipedia reported article Jeff Elder The Wall Street Journal June 16, 2014, strengthened rules laws undisclosed editing.[172] The article stated that: "Beginning Monday [from date article], changes Wikipedia's terms use require anyone paid edit articles disclose arrangement. Katherine Maher, nonprofit Wikimedia Foundation's chief communications officer, said changes address sentiment among volunteer editors that, 'we're advertising service; we're encyclopedia.'"[172][173][174][175][176] These issues, among others, parodied since first decade Wikipedia, notably Stephen Colbert The Colbert Report.[177] Most university lecturers discourage students citing encyclopedia academic work, preferring primary sources;[178] specifically prohibit Wikipedia citations.[179][180] Wales stresses encyclopedias type usually appropriate use citeable sources, relied upon authoritative.[181] Wales (2006 earlier) said receives ten emails weekly students saying got failing grades papers cited Wikipedia; told students got deserved. "For God's sake, you're college; don't cite encyclopedia", said.[182] In February 2007, article The Harvard Crimson newspaper reported professors Harvard University including Wikipedia articles syllabi, although without realizing articles might change.[183] In June 2007, former president American Library Association Michael Gorman condemned Wikipedia, along Google,[184] stating academics endorse use Wikipedia "the intellectual equivalent dietitian recommends steady diet Big Macs everything". A Harvard law textbook, Legal Research Nutshell (2011), cites Wikipedia "general source" "can real boon" "coming speed law governing situation" and, "while authoritative, provide basic facts well leads in-depth resources".[185] Medical information See also: Health information Wikipedia On March 5, 2014, Julie Beck writing The Atlantic magazine article titled "Doctors' #1 Source Healthcare Information: Wikipedia", stated "Fifty percent physicians look conditions (Wikipedia) site, editing articles improve quality available information."[186] Beck continued detail article new programs Dr. Amin Azzam University San Francisco offer medical school courses medical students learning edit improve Wikipedia articles health-related issues, well internal quality control programs within Wikipedia organized Dr. James Heilman improve group 200 health-related articles central medical importance Wikipedia's highest standard articles using Featured Article Good Article peer review evaluation process.[186] In May 7, 2014, follow-up article The Atlantic titled "Can Wikipedia Ever Be Definitive Medical Text?", Julie Beck quotes Wikiproject Medicine's Dr. James Heilman stating: "Just reference peer-reviewed doesn't mean it's high-quality reference."[187] Beck added that: "Wikipedia peer review process articles classified 'good' 'featured.' Heilman, participated process before, says 'less 1 percent' Wikipedia's medical articles passed.[187] Quality writing In 2008, researchers Carnegie Mellon University found quality Wikipedia article would suffer rather gain adding writers article lacked appropriate explicit implicit coordination.[188] For instance, contributors rewrite small portions entry rather making full-length revisions, high- low-quality content may intermingled within entry. Roy Rosenzweig, history professor, stated American National Biography Online outperformed Wikipedia terms "clear engaging prose", which, said, important aspect good historical writing.[189] Contrasting Wikipedia's treatment Abraham Lincoln Civil War historian James McPherson American National Biography Online, said essentially accurate covered major episodes Lincoln's life, praised "McPherson's richer contextualization […] artful use quotations capture Lincoln's voice […] […] ability convey profound message handful words." By contrast, gives example Wikipedia's prose finds "both verbose dull". Rosenzweig also criticized "waffling—encouraged NPOV policy—[which] means hard discern overall interpretive stance Wikipedia history". By example, quoted conclusion Wikipedia's article William Clarke Quantrill. While generally praising article, pointed "waffling" conclusion: "Some historians […] remember opportunistic, bloodthirsty outlaw, others continue view daring soldier local folk hero."[189] Other critics made similar charges that, even Wikipedia articles factually accurate, often written poor, almost unreadable style. Frequent Wikipedia critic Andrew Orlowski commented: "Even Wikipedia entry 100 per cent factually correct, facts carefully chosen, often reads translated one language another third, passing illiterate translator stage."[190] A study Wikipedia articles cancer conducted 2010 Yaacov Lawrence Kimmel Cancer Center Thomas Jefferson University. The study limited articles could found Physician Data Query excluded written "start" class "stub" class level. Lawrence found articles accurate readable, thought "Wikipedia's lack readability (to non-college readers) may reflect varied origins haphazard editing".[191] The Economist argued better-written articles tend reliable: "inelegant ranting prose usually reflects muddled thoughts incomplete information".[192] Coverage topics systemic bias See also: Notability English Wikipedia Criticism Wikipedia §Systemic bias coverage Parts article (those related d:Wikidata:Statistics/Wikipedia) need updated. Please update article reflect recent events newly available information. (March 2017) Wikipedia seeks create summary human knowledge form online encyclopedia, topic covered encyclopedically one article. Since terabytes disk space, far topics covered printed encyclopedia.[193] The exact degree manner coverage Wikipedia constant review editors, disagreements uncommon (see deletionism inclusionism).[194][195] Wikipedia contains materials people may find objectionable, offensive, pornographic Wikipedia censored. The policy sometimes proved controversial: 2008, Wikipedia rejected online petition inclusion images Muhammad English edition Muhammad article, citing policy. The presence politically, religiously, pornographically sensitive materials Wikipedia led censorship Wikipedia national authorities China,[196] Pakistan,[197] United Kingdom,[198] among countries. Pie chart Wikipedia content subject January 2008[199] A 2008 study conducted researchers Carnegie Mellon University Palo Alto Research Center gave distribution topics well growth (from July 2006 January 2008) field:[199] Culture arts: 30% (210%) Biographies persons: 15% (97%) Geography places: 14% (52%) Society social sciences: 12% (83%) History events: 11% (143%) Natural physical sciences: 9% (213%) Technology applied sciences: 4% (−6%) Religions belief systems: 2% (38%) Health: 2% (42%) Mathematics logic: 1% (146%) Thought philosophy: 1% (160%) These numbers refer quantity articles: possible one topic contain large number short articles another contain small number large ones. Through "Wikipedia Loves Libraries" program, Wikipedia partnered major public libraries New York Public Library Performing Arts expand coverage underrepresented subjects articles.[200] A 2011 study conducted researchers University Minnesota indicated male female editors focus different coverage topics. There greater concentration females People Arts category, males focus Geography Science.[201] Coverage topics selection bias Research conducted Mark Graham Oxford Internet Institute 2009 indicated geographic distribution article topics highly uneven. Africa underrepresented.[202] An editorial The Guardian 2014 noted women porn stars better covered women writers example.[203] Systemic bias When multiple editors contribute one topic set topics, systemic bias may arise, due demographic backgrounds editors. In 2011, Wales noted unevenness coverage reflection demography editors, predominantly consists young males high education levels developed world (cf. previously).[49] The October 22, 2013 essay Tom Simonite MIT's Technology Review titled "The Decline Wikipedia" discussed effect systemic bias policy creep downward trend number editors.[50] Systemic bias Wikipedia may follow culture generally, example favoring certain nationalities, ethnicities majority religions.[204] It may specifically follow biases Internet culture, inclining young, male, English-speaking, educated, technologically aware, wealthy enough spare time editing. Biases may include over-emphasis topics pop culture, technology, current events.[204] Taha Yasseri University Oxford, 2013, studied statistical trends systemic bias Wikipedia introduced editing conflicts resolution.[205][206] His research examined counterproductive work behavior edit warring. Yasseri contended simple reverts "undo" operations significant measure counterproductive behavior Wikipedia relied instead statistical measurement detecting "reverting/reverted pairs" "mutually reverting edit pairs". Such "mutually reverting edit pair" defined one editor reverts edit another editor then, sequence, returns revert first editor "mutually reverting edit pairs". The results tabulated several language versions Wikipedia. The English Wikipedia's three largest conflict rates belonged articles George W. Bush, Anarchism Muhammad.[206] By comparison, German Wikipedia, three largest conflict rates time Oxford study articles covering (i) Croatia, (ii) Scientology (iii) 9/11 conspiracy theories.[206] Researchers Washington University developed statistical model measure systematic bias behavior Wikipedia's users regarding controversial topics. The authors focused behavioral changes encyclopedia's administrators assuming post, writing systematic bias occurred fact.[207][208] Identifying filter-bubble problem Dimitra Kessenides, writing Bloomberg News Weekly, identified 'filter-bubble' problem recurrent long-standing issue Wikipedia.[209] As Kessenides states: "If way get article developing world published Wikipedia know former board member, hard imagine random editor Johannesburg Bangalore would hope... This so-called filter-bubble problem, coined Eli Pariser, co-founder viral video site Upworthy, idea internet contribute insularity certain communities. Filter bubbles blamed spread misinformation 2016 presidential election failure pundits U.K. anticipate Brexit... Wikipedia's filter-bubble problem particularly acute threat organization whose stated mission 'to empower engage people around world.'"[209] Explicit content See also: Internet Watch Foundation Wikipedia Reporting child pornography images Wikimedia Commons “ Problem? What problem? So, didn't know Wikipedia porn problem? ” —Larry Sanger, [210] Wikipedia criticized allowing information graphic content. Articles depicting arguably objectionable content (such Feces, Cadaver, Human penis, Vulva, Nudity) contain graphic pictures detailed information easily available anyone access internet, including children. The site also includes sexual content images videos masturbation ejaculation, photographs nude children, illustrations zoophilia, photos hardcore pornographic films articles. The Wikipedia article Virgin Killer—a 1976 album German heavy metal band Scorpions—features picture album's original cover, depicts naked prepubescent girl. The original release cover caused controversy replaced countries. In December 2008, access Wikipedia article Virgin Killer blocked four days Internet service providers United Kingdom reported member public child pornography,[211] Internet Watch Foundation (IWF), issues stop list Internet service providers. IWF, non-profit, non-government-affiliated organization, later criticized inclusion picture "distasteful".[212] In April 2010, Sanger wrote letter Federal Bureau Investigation, outlining concerns two categories images Wikimedia Commons contained child pornography, violation US federal obscenity law.[213] Sanger later clarified images, related pedophilia one lolicon, real children, said constituted "obscene visual representations sexual abuse children", PROTECT Act 2003.[214] That law bans photographic child pornography cartoon images drawings children obscene American law.[214] Sanger also expressed concerns access images Wikipedia schools.[215] Wikimedia Foundation spokesman Jay Walsh strongly rejected Sanger's accusation,[216] saying Wikipedia "material would deem illegal. If did, would remove it."[216] Following complaint Sanger, Wales deleted sexual images without consulting community. After editors volunteer maintain site argued decision delete made hastily, Wales voluntarily gave powers held time part co-founder status. He wrote message Wikimedia Foundation mailing-list action "in interest encouraging discussion real philosophical/content issues, rather quickly I acted".[217] Critics, including Wikipediocracy, noticed many pornographic images deleted Wikipedia since 2010 reappeared.[218] Privacy One privacy concern case Wikipedia right private citizen remain "private citizen" rather "public figure" eyes law.[219][notes 8] It battle right anonymous cyberspace right anonymous real life ("meatspace"). A particular problem occurs case individual relatively unimportant exists Wikipedia page wishes. In January 2006, German court ordered German Wikipedia shut within Germany stated full name Boris Floricic, aka "Tron", deceased hacker. On February 9, 2006, injunction Wikimedia Deutschland overturned, court rejecting notion Tron's right privacy parents violated.[220] Wikipedia "Volunteer Response Team" uses OTRS system handle queries without reveal identities involved parties. This used, example, confirming permission using individual images media project.[221] Sexism Wikipedia described harboring battleground culture sexism harassment.[222][223] The perceived toxic attitudes tolerance violent abusive language also reasons put forth gender gap Wikipedia editors.[224] In 2014, female editor requested separate space Wikipedia discuss improving civility proposal referred male editor using words "the easiest way avoid called cunt act like one."[225] Operation A group Wikipedia editors may form WikiProject focus work specific topic area, using associated discussion page coordinate changes across multiple articles.[226] Wikimedia Foundation Wikimedia movement affiliates Main article: Wikimedia Foundation Katherine Maher third executive director Wikimedia, following departure Lila Tretikov 2016. Wikipedia hosted funded Wikimedia Foundation, non-profit organization also operates Wikipedia-related projects Wiktionary Wikibooks. The foundation relies public contributions grants fund mission.[227] The foundation's 2013 IRS Form 990 shows revenue $39.7 million expenses almost $29 million, assets $37.2 million liabilities $2.3 million.[228] In May 2014, Wikimedia Foundation named Lila Tretikov second executive director, taking Sue Gardner.[229] The Wall Street Journal reported May 1, 2014, Tretikov's information technology background years University California offers Wikipedia opportunity develop concentrated directions guided often repeated position statement that, "Information, like air, wants free."[230][231] The Wall Street Journal article reported directions development according interview spokesman Jay Walsh Wikimedia, "said Tretikov would address issue (paid advocacy) priority. 'We really pushing toward transparency... We reinforcing paid advocacy welcome.' Initiatives involve greater diversity contributors, better mobile support Wikipedia, new geo-location tools find local content easily, tools users second third world also priorities, Walsh said."[230] Following departure Tretikov Wikipedia due issues concerning use "superprotection" feature language versions Wikipedia adopted, Katherine Maher became third executive director Wikimedia Foundation June 2016.[232] Maher stated one priorities would issue editor harassment endemic Wikipedia identified Wikipedia board December. Maher stated regarding harassment issue that: "It establishes sense within community priority... (and correction requires that) words."[233] Wikipedia also supported many organizations groups affiliated Wikimedia Foundation independently-run, called Wikimedia movement affiliates. These include Wikimedia chapters (which national sub-national organizations, Wikimedia Deutschland Wikimédia France), thematic organizations (such Amical Wikimedia Catalan language community), user groups. These affiliates participate promotion, development, funding Wikipedia. Software operations support See also: MediaWiki The operation Wikipedia depends MediaWiki, custom-made, free open source wiki software platform written PHP built upon MySQL database system.[234] The software incorporates programming features macro language, variables, transclusion system templates, URL redirection. MediaWiki licensed GNU General Public License used Wikimedia projects, well many wiki projects. Originally, Wikipedia ran UseModWiki written Perl Clifford Adams (Phase I), initially required CamelCase article hyperlinks; present double bracket style incorporated later. Starting January 2002 (Phase II), Wikipedia began running PHP wiki engine MySQL database; software custom-made Wikipedia Magnus Manske. The Phase II software repeatedly modified accommodate exponentially increasing demand. In July 2002 (Phase III), Wikipedia shifted third-generation software, MediaWiki, originally written Lee Daniel Crocker. Several MediaWiki extensions installed[235] extend functionality MediaWiki software. In April 2005, Lucene extension[236][237] added MediaWiki's built-in search Wikipedia switched MySQL Lucene searching. The site currently uses Lucene Search 2.1,[238][needs update] written Java based Lucene library 2.3.[239] In July 2013, extensive beta testing, WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) extension, VisualEditor, opened public use.[240][241][242][243] It met much rejection criticism, described "slow buggy".[244] The feature changed opt-out opt-in afterward. Automated editing Computer programs called bots used widely perform simple repetitive tasks, correcting common misspellings stylistic issues, start articles geography entries standard format statistical data.[245][246][247] One controversial contributor massively creating articles bot reported create ten thousand articles Swedish Wikipedia certain days.[248] There also bots designed automatically notify editors make common editing errors (such unmatched quotes unmatched parenthesis).[249] Edits misidentified bot work banned editor restored editors. An anti-vandal bot tries detect revert vandalism quickly automatically.[246] Bots also report edits particular accounts IP address ranges, done time MH17 jet downing incident July 2014.[250] Bots Wikipedia must approved prior activation.[251] According Andrew Lih, current expansion Wikipedia millions articles would difficult envision without use bots.[252] Wikiprojects, assessments articles' importance quality This section transcluded English Wikipedia. (edit | history) Main article: WikiProject A "WikiProject" group contributors want work together team improve Wikipedia. These groups often focus specific topic area (for example, women's history), specific location specific kind task (for example, checking newly created pages). The English Wikipedia currently 2,000 WikiProjects activity varies.[253] In 2007, preparation producing print version, English Wikipedia introduced assessment scale quality articles.[254] Articles rated WikiProjects. The range quality classes begins "Stub" (very short pages), followed "Start", "C" "B" (in increasing order quality). Community peer review needed article enter one highest quality classes: either "A", "good article" highest, "featured article". Of 4.4 million articles lists assessed March 2015, little 5,000 (0.12%) featured articles, fewer 2,000 (0.04%) featured lists. One featured article per day, selected editors, appears main page Wikipedia.[255][256] The articles also rated per "importance" judged WikiProject. Currently, 5 importance categories: "low", "mid", "high", "top", "???" unclassified/uncertain level. For particular article, different WikiProjects may assign different importance levels. The Wikipedia Version 1.0 Editorial Team developed table (shown below) displays data rated articles quality importance, English Wikipedia. If article list receives different ratings two WikiProjects, highest rating used table, pie-charts, bar-chart. The software regularly auto-updates data. Researcher Giacomo Poderi found articles tend reach featured status via intensive work editors.[257] A 2010 study found unevenness quality among featured articles concluded community process ineffective assessing quality articles.[258] Quality-wise distribution 5.5 million articles lists English Wikipedia, 29 January 2017[update][259] Featured articles (0.11%) Featured lists (0.04%) A class (0.03%) Good articles (0.50%) B class (2.00%) C class (4.32%) Start class (26.41%) Stub class (53.01%) Lists (3.65%) Unassessed (9.94%) Importance-wise distribution 5.5 million articles lists English Wikipedia, 29 January 2017[update][259] Top (0.91%) High (3.20%) Medium (12.21%) Low (51.68%) ???

Similar publications German-language Kurier, Portuguese-language Correio da Wikipédia. Other past present community news publications English Wikipedia include "Wikiworld" web comic, Wikipedia Weekly podcast, newsletters specific WikiProjects like The Bugle WikiProject Military History monthly newsletter The Guild Copy Editors. There also number publications Wikimedia Foundation multilingual publications Wikimedia Blog This Month Education. Access content Content licensing When project started 2001, text Wikipedia covered GNU Free Documentation License (GFDL), copyleft license permitting redistribution, creation derivative works, commercial use content authors retain copyright work.[271] The GFDL created software manuals come free software programs licensed GPL. This made poor choice general reference work: example, GFDL requires reprints materials Wikipedia come full copy GFDL text. In December 2002, Creative Commons license released: specifically designed creative works general, software manuals. The license gained popularity among bloggers others distributing creative works Web. The Wikipedia project sought switch Creative Commons.[272] Because two licenses, GFDL Creative Commons, incompatible, November 2008, following request project, Free Software Foundation (FSF) released new version GFDL designed specifically allow Wikipedia relicense content CC BY-SA August 1, 2009. (A new version GFDL automatically covers Wikipedia contents.) In April 2009, Wikipedia sister projects held community-wide referendum decided switch June 2009.[273][274][275][276] The handling media files (e.g. image files) varies across language editions. Some language editions, English Wikipedia, include non-free image files fair use doctrine, others opted to, part lack fair use doctrines home countries (e.g. Japanese copyright law). Media files covered free content licenses (e.g. Creative Commons' CC BY-SA) shared across language editions via Wikimedia Commons repository, project operated Wikimedia Foundation. Wikipedia's accommodation varying international copyright laws regarding images led observe photographic coverage topics lags behind quality encyclopedic text.[277] The Wikimedia Foundation licensor content, merely hosting service contributors (and licensors) Wikipedia. This position successfully defended court.[278][279] Methods access Because Wikipedia content distributed open license, anyone reuse re-distribute charge. The content Wikipedia published many forms, online offline, outside Wikipedia website. Websites – Thousands "mirror sites" exist republish content Wikipedia: two prominent ones, also include content reference sources, Reference.com Answers.com. Another example Wapedia, began display Wikipedia content mobile-device-friendly format Wikipedia did. Mobile apps – A variety mobile apps provide access Wikipedia hand-held devices, including Android iOS devices (see Wikipedia apps). (See also Mobile access.) Search engines – Some web search engines make special use Wikipedia content displaying search results: examples include Bing (via technology gained Powerset)[280] DuckDuckGo. Compact discs, DVDs – Collections Wikipedia articles published optical discs. An English version, 2006 Wikipedia CD Selection, contained 2,000 articles.[281][282] The Polish-language version contains nearly 240,000 articles.[283] There German- Spanish-language versions well.[284][285] Also, "Wikipedia Schools", Wikipedia series CDs / DVDs produced Wikipedians SOS Children, free, hand-checked, non-commercial selection Wikipedia targeted around UK National Curriculum intended useful much English-speaking world.[286] The project available online; equivalent print encyclopedia would require roughly 20 volumes. Printed books – There efforts put select subset Wikipedia's articles printed book form.[287][288] Since 2009, tens thousands print-on-demand books reproduced English, German, Russian French Wikipedia articles produced American company Books LLC three Mauritian subsidiaries German publisher VDM.[289] Semantic Web – The website DBpedia, begun 2007, extracts data infoboxes category declarations English-language Wikipedia. Wikimedia created Wikidata project similar objective storing basic facts page Wikipedia WMF wikis make available queriable semantic format, RDF. This still development. As Feb 2014 15,000,000 items 1,000 properties describing them. Obtaining full contents Wikipedia reuse presents challenges, since direct cloning via web crawler discouraged.[290] Wikipedia publishes "dumps" contents, text-only; 2007[update] dump available Wikipedia's images.[291] Several languages Wikipedia also maintain reference desk, volunteers answer questions general public. According study Pnina Shachaf Journal Documentation, quality Wikipedia reference desk comparable standard library reference desk, accuracy 55%.[292] Mobile access See also: Help:Mobile access The mobile version English Wikipedia's main page Wikipedia's original medium users read edit content using standard web browser fixed Internet connection. Although Wikipedia content accessible mobile web since July 2013, The New York Times February 9, 2014, quoted Erik Möller, deputy director Wikimedia Foundation, stating transition internet traffic desktops mobile devices significant cause concern worry.[16] The article The New York Times reported comparison statistics mobile edits stating that, "Only 20 percent readership English-language Wikipedia comes via mobile devices, figure substantially lower percentage mobile traffic media sites, many approach 50 percent. And shift mobile editing lagged even more."[16] The New York Times reports Möller assigned "a team 10 software developers focused mobile", total approximately 200 employees working Wikimedia Foundation. One principal concern cited The New York Times "worry" Wikipedia effectively address attrition issues number editors online encyclopedia attracts edit maintain content mobile access environment.[16] Bloomberg Businessweek reported July 2014 Google's Android mobile apps dominated largest share global smartphone shipments 2013 78.6% market share next closest competitor iOS 15.2% market.[293] At time Tretikov appointment posted web interview Sue Gardner May 2014, Wikimedia representatives made technical announcement concerning number mobile access systems market seeking access Wikipedia. Directly posted web interview, representatives stated Wikimedia would applying all-inclusive approach accommodate many mobile access systems possible efforts expanding general mobile access, including BlackBerry Windows Phone system, making market share secondary issue.[231] The latest version Android app Wikipedia released July 23, 2014, generally positive reviews, scoring four possible five poll approximately 200,000 users downloading Google.[294] The latest version iOS released April 3, 2013, similar reviews.[295] Access Wikipedia mobile phones possible early 2004, Wireless Application Protocol (WAP), via Wapedia service.
