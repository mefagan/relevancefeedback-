instead, water seeps calcitic mud called marl. algae other microscopic organisms form periphyton, attaches limestone. dries turns gray mud.[25] sawgrass other water plants grow shorter freshwater marl peat, other type soil everglades found water remains present longer throughout year. marl prairies usually water three seven months year, whereas sloughs may remain submerged longer nine months sometimes remain water one year next. sawgrass may dominate sloughs, creating monoculture. other grasses, muhly grass (muhlenbergia filipes) broad-leafed water plants, found marl prairies.[26] animals living freshwater sloughs also inhabit marl prairies. marl prairies may go dry some parts year; alligators play vital role maintaining life remote parts everglades burrowing mud dry season, creating pools water fish amphibians survive one year next. alligator holes also attract other animals congregate feed smaller prey. region floods wet season, fish amphibians sustained alligator holes repopulate freshwater marl prairies.[27] tropical hardwood hammocks[edit] main article: tropical hardwood hammock hammocks often dry land within park. rise several inches grass-covered river, dominated diverse plant life consisting subtropical tropical trees, large southern live oaks (quercus virginiana). trees often form canopies animals thrive amongst scrub bushes wild coffee (psychotria), white indigoberry (randia aculeata), poisonwood (metopium toxiferum) saw palmetto (serenoa repens). park features thousands tree islands amid sloughs—which often form shape teardrop seen (see park map) slowly moving water around them—but also found pineland mangroves. trees everglades, including wild tamarind (lysiloma latisiliquum) gumbo-limbo (bursera simaruba), rarely grow higher 50 feet (15m) due wind, cold weather, lightning strikes.[28][29] approximately 160 florida panthers still live wild, usually drier parts everglades, hammocks pinelands. plant growth around hammock base nearly impenetrable;
