It also refer collection tools, machinery, modifications, environmental arrangement procedures. Technologies significantly affect human well animal species' ability control adapt natural environments. The word technology comes Greek τεχνολογία (technología); τέχνη (téchnē), meaning 'art, skill, craft', -λογία (-logía), meaning 'study of-'. The term applied either generally many specific areas, examples include construction technology, medical technology information technology. The human species' use technology began conversion natural resources simple tools. The prehistorical discovery ability control fire increased available sources food invention wheel helped humans travelling controlling environment. Recent technological developments, including printing press, telephone, Internet, lessened physical barriers communication allowed humans interact freely global scale. However, technology used peaceful purposes; development weapons ever-increasing destructive power progressed throughout history, clubs nuclear weapons. Technology affected society surroundings number ways. In many societies, technology helped develop advanced economies (including today's global economy) allowed rise leisure class. Many technological processes produce unwanted by-products, known pollution, deplete natural resources, detriment Earth environment. Various implementations technology influence values society new technology often raises new ethical questions. Examples include rise notion efficiency terms human productivity, term originally applied machines, challenge traditional norms. Philosophical debates arisen present future use technology society, disagreements whether technology improves human condition worsens it. Neo-Luddism, anarcho-primitivism, similar movements criticise pervasiveness technology modern world, opining harms environment alienates people; proponents ideologies transhumanism techno-progressivism view continued technological progress beneficial society human condition. Indeed, recently, believed development technology restricted human beings, recent scientific studies indicate primates certain dolphin communities developed simple tools learned pass knowledge generations.

Organised large scale joint committee Royal Society Royal Geographical Society, new expedition aimed carry scientific research geographical exploration largely untouched continent. It launched Antarctic careers many would become leading figures Heroic Age Antarctic exploration including Robert Falcon Scott led expedition, Ernest Shackleton, Edward Wilson, Frank Wild, Tom Crean William Lashly. Its scientific results covered extensive ground biology, zoology, geology, meteorology magnetism. There important geological zoological discoveries, including snow-free McMurdo Dry Valleys Cape Crozier Emperor Penguin colony. In field geographical exploration, achievements included discoveries King Edward VII Land, Polar Plateau via western mountains route.
