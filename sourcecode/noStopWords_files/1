It declared International Biosphere Reserve, World Heritage Site, Wetland International Importance, one three locations world appear three lists.[5] Most U.S. national parks preserve unique geographic features; Everglades National Park first created protect fragile ecosystem. The Everglades network wetlands forests fed river flowing 1⁄4 mile (400m) per day Lake Okeechobee, southwest Florida Bay.[6] The Park significant breeding ground tropical wading birds North America contains largest mangrove ecosystem western hemisphere.[7] It home 36threatened protected species including Florida panther, American crocodile, West Indian manatee, supports 350species birds, 300species fresh saltwater fish, 40species mammals, 50species reptiles.[8] The majority South Florida's fresh water, stored Biscayne Aquifer, recharged park.[9] Humans lived thousands years around Everglades.

Geology[edit] The terrain South Florida relatively consistently flat. The limestone underlies Everglades integral formation diverse ecosystems within park. Florida part African portion supercontinent Gondwana. After separated, conditions allowed shallow marine environment deposit calcium carbonate sand, shells, coral converted limestone.[11] Tiny bits shell, sand, bryozoans compressed multiple layers forming unique structures limestone called ooids, created porous permeable conditions hold water.[12] The Florida peninsula appeared sea level 100,000 150,000years ago. As sea levels end Wisconsin ice age rose, water table appeared closer land. Lake Okeechobee began flood convection thunderstorms created.[13] Vast peat deposits south Lake Okeechobee indicate regular flooding occurred 5,000 years ago. Plants began migrate, subtropical ones northern part Florida, tropicals carried seeds birds islands Caribbean.[14] The limestone shelf appears flat, slight rises—called pinnacles—and depressions caused erosion limestone acidic properties water. The amount time throughout year water present location Everglades determines type soil, two Everglades: peat, created many years decomposing plant matter, marl, result dried periphyton, chunks algae microorganisms create grayish mud. Portions Everglades remain flooded nine months year usually covered peat. Areas flooded six months less covered marl. Plant communities determined type soil amount water present.[15][16] Climate[edit] While common northern portion Florida, underground springs feed water Everglades system. An underground reservoir called Floridan Aquifer lies 1,000 feet (300m) surface South Florida.[17] The Everglades immense capacity water storage, owing permeable limestone beneath exposed land. Most water arrives form rainfall, significant amount stored limestone. Water evaporating Everglades becomes rain metropolitan areas, providing fresh water supply region. Water also flows park falling rain north onto watersheds Kissimmee River sources Lake Okeechobee, appear Everglades days later. Water overflows Lake Okeechobee river 40 70 miles (110km) wide, moves almost imperceptibly.[18] Everglades National Park tropical savanna climate (Köppen climate classification: Aw) tropical monsoon climate (Köppen climate classification: Am), depending location. Most central region savanna climate regions closer shore, especially eastern quarter park monsoonal climate. Both climates characterized two seasons: wet dry. The park's dry season lasts December April, temperatures vary 53°F (12°C) 77°F (25°C) humidity low. Since water levels time, animals congregate central water locations, providing popular opportunities viewing wildlife.[19] During wet season, May November, temperatures consistently 90°F (33°C) humidity times exceed 90percent.[20] Storms drop 10 12 inches (300mm) rain time, providing half year's average 60inches (152cm) rainfall two months.[21] Climate data Flamingo Ranger Station, FL Month Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Year Average high °F (°C) 76.6 (24.8) 78.1 (25.6) 79.6 (26.4) 83.0 (28.3) 86.6 (30.3) 88.9 (31.6) 90.0 (32.2) 90.4 (32.4) 89.3 (31.8) 86.6 (30.3) 82.4 (28) 78.5 (25.8) 84.17 (28.96) Average °F (°C) 56.4 (13.6) 59.0 (15) 61.2 (16.2) 64.2 (17.9) 69.8 (21) 74.5 (23.6) 75.2 (24) 75.4 (24.1) 74.7 (23.7) 70.7 (21.5) 64.8 (18.2) 59.7 (15.4) 67.13 (19.52) Average precipitation inches (mm) 1.70 (43.2) 1.73 (43.9) 1.99 (50.5) 1.84 (46.7) 3.49 (88.6) 7.18 (182.4) 5.60 (142.2) 7.87 (199.9) 6.31 (160.3) 3.83 (97.3) 2.44 (62) 1.67 (42.4) 45.65 (1,159.4) Source: [1] Ecosystems[edit] Main article: Geography ecology Everglades At turn 20th century common concepts protected national parks invariably included formidable geologic features like mountains, geysers, canyons. As Florida's population began grow significantly urban areas near Everglades developed, proponents park's establishment faced difficulty persuading federal government people Florida subtle constantly shifting ecosystems Everglades worthy protection.[22] When park established 1947, became first area within U.S. protect flora fauna native region opposed geologic scenery.[10] The National Park Service recognizes nine distinct interdependent ecosystems within park constantly shift size owing amount water present environmental factors. Freshwater sloughs marl prairies[edit] Alligators thrive freshwater sloughs marl prairies. Freshwater sloughs perhaps common ecosystem associated Everglades National Park. These drainage channels characterized low-lying areas covered fresh water, flowing almost imperceptible 100 feet (30m) per day.[23] Shark River Slough Taylor Slough significant features park. Sawgrass growing height 6 feet (1.8m) more, broad-leafed marsh plants, prominent region gave Everglades nickname "River Grass", cemented public imagination title Marjory Stoneman Douglas's book (1947), culminated years advocacy considering Everglades ecosystem "swamp". Excellent feeding locations birds, sloughs Everglades attract great variety waders herons, egrets, roseate spoonbills (Platalea ajaja), ibises brown pelicans (Pelecanus occidentalis), well limpkins (Aramus guarauna) snail kites eat apple snail, turn feed sawgrass. The sloughs' availability fish, amphibians, young birds attract variety freshwater turtles, alligator (Alligator mississippiensis), water moccasin (Agkistrodon piscivorus conanti), eastern diamondback rattlesnake (Crotalus adamanteus).[24] A great blue heron Anhinga Trail Freshwater marl prairies similar sloughs, lack slow movement surface water; instead, water seeps calcitic mud called marl. Algae microscopic organisms form periphyton, attaches limestone. When dries turns gray mud.[25] Sawgrass water plants grow shorter freshwater marl peat, type soil Everglades found water remains present longer throughout year. Marl prairies usually water three seven months year, whereas sloughs may remain submerged longer nine months sometimes remain water one year next. Sawgrass may dominate sloughs, creating monoculture. Other grasses, muhly grass (Muhlenbergia filipes) broad-leafed water plants found marl prairies.[26] Animals living freshwater sloughs also inhabit marl prairies. Marl prairies may go dry parts year; alligators play vital role maintaining life remote parts Everglades burrowing mud dry season, creating pools water fish amphibians survive one year next. Alligator holes also attract animals congregate feed smaller prey. When region floods wet season, fish amphibians sustained alligator holes repopulate freshwater marl prairies.[27] Tropical hardwood hammocks[edit] Main article: Tropical hardwood hammock Hammocks often dry land within park. They rise several inches grass-covered river, dominated diverse plant life consisting subtropical tropical trees, large southern live oaks (Quercus virginiana). Trees often form canopies animals thrive amongst scrub bushes wild coffee (Psychotria), white indigoberry (Randia aculeata), poisonwood (Metopium toxiferum) saw palmetto (Serenoa repens). The park features thousands tree islands amid sloughs—which often form shape teardrop seen (see park map) slowly moving water around them—but also found pineland mangroves. Trees Everglades, including wild tamarind (Lysiloma latisiliquum) gumbo-limbo (Bursera simaruba), rarely grow higher 50 feet (15m) due wind, cold weather, lightning strikes.[28][29] Approximately 160 Florida panthers still live wild, usually drier parts Everglades, hammocks pinelands. The plant growth around hammock base nearly impenetrable; beneath canopy hammocks ideal habitat animals. Reptiles (such various species snake anole) amphibians (such American green tree frog, Hyla cinerea), live hardwood hammocks. Birds barred owls (Strix varia), woodpeckers, northern cardinals (Cardinalis cardinalis), southern bald eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) nest hammock trees. Mammal species living hardwood hammocks include opossums (Didelphis virginiana), raccoons (Procyon lotor), bobcats (Lynx rufus), Everglades minks (Neovison vison), marsh rabbits (Sylvilagus palustris), white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), rare, critically endangered Florida panther (Puma concolor coryi).[28] Pineland[edit] Sunrise pine rocklands Long Pine Key Nature Trail. Dade County covered 186,000 acres (750km2) pine rockland forests, harvested lumber industry.[30] Pineland ecosystems (or pine rocklands) characterized shallow, dry sandy loam limestone substrate covered almost exclusively slash pines (Pinus elliottii var. densa). Trees ecosystem grow solution holes, soft limestone worn away filled soil, allowing plants take hold.[31] Pinelands require regular maintenance fire ensure existence. South Florida slash pines uniquely adapted promote fire dropping large amount dried pine needles shedding dry bark. Pine cones require heat fires open, allowing seeds disperse take hold. The trunks roots slash pines resistant fire. Prescribed burns areas take place every three seven years; without regular fires, hardwood trees begin grow region pinelands become recategorized mixed swamp forests.[32] Most plants area bloom 16 weeks fire.[33] Nearly pinelands understory palm shrubs, diverse ground covering wild herbs.[32] Pine rocklands considered one threatened habitats Florida; less 4,000 acres (16km2) pineland exist outside park.[34] Within park, 20,000 acres (81km2) pineland protected.[35] A variety animal species meet needs food, shelter, nesting, rooking pine rocklands. Woodpeckers, eastern meadowlarks (Sturnella magna), loggerhead shrikes (Lanius ludovicianus), grackles, northern mockingbirds (Mimus polyglottos) commonly found pinelands. Black bears Florida panthers also live habitat.[32] Cypress mangrove[edit] Cypress trees conifers adapted live standing fresh water. They grow compact structures called cypress domes long strands limestone. Water levels may fluctuate dramatically around cypress domes strands, cypress bromeliads, Spanish moss (Tillandsia usneoides), orchids ferns grow branches trunks cypress trees. Everglades National Park features 25 species orchids.[36] Tall cypress trees provide excellent nesting areas birds including wild turkey (Meleagris gallopavo), ibis, herons, egrets, anhingas (Anhinga anhinga), belted kingfisher (Megaceryle alcyon). Mammals cypress regions include white-tailed deer, squirrels, raccoons, opossums, skunks, swamp rabbits, river otters (Lontra canadensis), bobcats, well small rodents.[37][38] Mangrove trees along coastline protect shore erosion. Mangrove trees cover coastlines South Florida, sometimes growing inland depending amount salt water present within Everglades ecosystems. During drier years less fresh water flows coast, mangroves appear among fresh water plants. When rain abundant, sawgrass fresh water plants may found closer coast. Three species mangrove trees—red (Rhizophora mangle), black (Avicennia germinans), white (Laguncularia racemosa)—can found Everglades. Due high tolerance salt water, winds, extreme tides, high temperatures, muddy soils, mangrove trees uniquely adapted extreme conditions. They act nurseries many marine bird species. They also Florida's first defense destructive forces hurricanes, absorbing flood waters preventing coastal erosion.[39] The mangrove system Everglades National Park largest continuous system mangroves world.[40] Within Florida mangrove systems live 220species fish, variety crabs, crayfish, shrimp, mollusks, invertebrates, serve main source food many birds.[41] Dozens bird species mangroves nurseries food stores, including pelicans, grebes, tricolored herons (Egretta tricolor), gulls, terns, hawks kites, arboreal birds like mangrove cuckoos (Coccyzus minor), yellow warblers (Dendroica petechia), white-crowned pigeons (Patagioenas leucocephala).[42] The mangroves also support 24species amphibians reptiles, 18species mammals, including endangered green turtle (Chelonia mydas), hawksbill turtle (Eretmochelys imbricata), West Indian manatee (Trichechus manatus).[43] Coastal lowlands[edit] Coastal lowlands, wet prairies, salt water marshes absorb marine water gets high fresh water rains heavy. Floods occur hurricane tropical storm surges ocean water rise several feet land.[44] Heavy wet seasons also floods rain north flows Everglades. Few trees survive conditions region, plants—succulents like saltwort glasswort—tolerate salt, brackish water, desert conditions. Animal life zone dependent upon amount water present, commonly found animals include Cape Sable seaside sparrow (Ammodramus maritimus mirabilis), Everglades snail kite (Rostrhamus sociabilis), wood stork (Mycteria americana), eastern indigo snake (Drymarchon couperi), small mammals rats, mice, rabbits.[45] Marine estuarine[edit] The largest body water within park Florida Bay, extends mangrove swamps mainland's southern tip Florida Keys. Over 800 square miles (2,100km2) marine ecosystem lies range. Coral, sponges, seagrasses serve shelter food crustaceans mollusks, turn primary food source larger marine animals. Sharks, stingrays, barracudas also live ecosystem, larger species fish attract sport fishing. Pelicans, shorebirds, terns, black skimmers (Rynchops niger) among birds frequenting park shorelines.[46] The bay also resident population bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus).[47] Human history[edit] Native peoples[edit] The sun sets Shark River Slough. Main article: Indigenous people Everglades region Humans likely first inhabited South Florida region 10,000 20,000years ago.[48] Two tribes Native Americans developed peninsula's southern tip: Tequesta lived eastern side Calusa, greater numbers, western side. The Everglades served natural boundary them. The Tequesta lived single large community near mouth Miami River, Calusa lived 30villages. Both groups traveled Everglades, rarely lived within them, remaining mostly along coast.[48] The diets groups consisted mostly shellfish fish, small mammals, game, wild plants. Having access soft limestone, tools fashioned Native Americans region made shell, bone, wood, animal teeth; shark teeth used cutting blades,[49] sharpened reeds became arrows spears.[50] Shell mounds still exist today within park, giving archaeologists anthropologists evidence raw materials available indigenous people tool construction. Spanish explorers estimated number Tequesta first contact around 800, Calusa 2,000; National Park Service reports probably 20,000 natives living near Everglades Spanish established contact late 16th century.[51] The Calusa society advanced, lived social strata, able create canals, earthworks, shellworks. The Calusa also able resist Spanish attempts conquest.[49] The Spanish contact societies, established missions north, near Lake Okeechobee. In 18th century, invading Creeks incorporated dwindling numbers Tequesta own. Neither Tequesta Calusa tribe existed 1800.[52] Disease, warfare, capture slavery reasons eradication groups. The evidence existence within park boundaries series shell mounds built Calusa.[53] In early 19th century, Creeks, escaped African slaves, Indians northern Florida displaced Creek War formed area's Seminole nation. After end Seminole Wars 1842, Seminoles faced relocation Indian territory near Oklahoma. A hundred Seminole hunters scouts settled within today Big Cypress National Preserve, escape forced emigration west.[54] From 1859 1930, Seminoles Miccosukee, similar linguistically unique tribe, lived relative isolation, making living trading. In 1928, surveying construction began Tamiami Trail, along northern border Everglades National Park. The road bisected Everglades also introduced steady, small, traffic white settlers Everglades.[55] Some members Miccosukee Seminole tribes continue live within park boundaries. Management park includes approval new policies procedures tribal representatives "in manner conflict park purpose".[56] American settlements[edit] Following end Seminole Wars, Americans began settling isolated points along coast park, Ten Thousand Islands Cape Sable. Communities developed two largest pieces dry ground area, Chokoloskee Island Flamingo Cape Sable, established post offices early 1890s.[57] Chokoloskee Island shell mound, midden built roughly 20feet (6m) high thousands years occupation Calusa. The settlements Chokoloskee Flamingo served trading centers small populations farmers, fishermen charcoal burners settled Ten Thousand Islands. Both settlements isolated homesteads reached boat well 20th century. Everglades City, mainland near Chokoloskee, enjoyed brief period prosperity when, beginning 1920, served headquarters construction Tamiami Trail. A dirt road Florida City reached Flamingo 1922, causeway finally connected Chokoloskee mainland's Everglades City 1956.[58][59] After park established, residents Flamingo bought out, site incorporated park visitor center.[57] Land development conservation[edit] Main article: Draining development Everglades A canal lock constructed Everglades 1906 Several attempts made drain develop Everglades 1880s. The first canals built Everglades little harm ecosystem, unable drain much it.[60] Napoleon Bonaparte Broward based majority 1904 campaign governor drainage create "The Empire Everglades".[61] Broward ordered drainage took place 1905 1910, successful enough land developers sold tracts $30 acre, settling town Davie, developing regions Lee Dade counties. The canals also cleared water made way agricultural fields growing sugarcane.[62][63] The 1920s saw population boom South Florida created Florida land boom fueled demand land described author Michael Grunwald "insanity".[64] Land sold homes structures built it, cases plans construction place. New landowners, eager make good investments, hastily constructed homes small towns recently drained land. Mangrove trees coasts taken better views replaced shallow rooted palm trees. The U.S. Army Corps Engineers began construction larger canals control rising waters Everglades. Nevertheless, Lake Okeechobee continued rise fall, region covered rain, city planners continued battle water. The 1926 Miami Hurricane caused Lake Okeechobee levees fail; hundreds people moved south lake drowned. Two years later, 1928 Okeechobee Hurricane claimed 2,500lives Lake Okeechobee surged levees. Politicians declared Everglades uninhabitable silenced four-story wall, named Herbert Hoover Dike, built around Lake Okeechobee. This wall effectively cut water source Everglades.[65] Following wall's construction, South Florida endured drought severe enough massive wildfires 1939. The influx humans detrimental effect plants animals region melaleuca trees (Melaleuca quinquenervia) introduced help drainage, along Australian pines brought developers windbreaks. The region's timber devastated lumber supplies. Alligators, birds, frogs, fish hunted massive scale. Entire rookeries wading birds shot collect plumes, used women's hats early 20th century.[66] The largest impact people region diversion water away Everglades. Canals deepened widened, water levels fell dramatically, causing chaos food webs.[67] Salt water replaced fresh water canals, 1997 scientists noticed salt water seeping Biscayne Aquifer, South Florida's water source.[68] In 1940s, freelance writer former reporter The Miami Herald named Marjory Stoneman Douglas began research Everglades assignment Miami River. She studied land water five years, published The Everglades: River Grass 1947, describing area great detail, including chapter disappearance. She wrote: "What river grass sweet water given meaning life uniqueness enormous geography centuries man place made, one chaotic gesture greed ignorance folly, river fire."[69] The book sold 500,000 copies since publication, Douglas' continued dedication ecology conservation earned nicknames "Grand Dame Everglades", "Grandmother Everglades" "the anti-Christ" singular focus expense political interests.[70] She founded served president organization called Friends Everglades, initially intended protest construction proposed Big Cypress jetport 1968. Successful confrontation, organization grown 4,000 members, committed preservation Everglades.[71] She wrote spoke importance Everglades death age 108 1998. Park history[edit] Further information: Ernest F. Coe Cape Sable seen Spot Satellite Floridians hoping preserve least part Everglades began express concern diminishing resources early 20th century. Royal Palm State Park created 1916; included several trails visitor's center several miles Homestead. Miami-based naturalists first proposed area become national park 1923. Five years later, Florida state legislature established Tropical Everglades National Park Commission study formation protected area.[72] The commission led land developer turned conservationist named Ernest F. Coe, eventually nicknamed Father Everglades National Park.[73] Coe's original plan park included 2,000,000 acres (8,100km2) including Key Largo Big Cypress, unwillingness compromise almost prevented park's creation. Various interests, including land developers sport hunters, demanded land trimmed.[72] The commission also tasked proposing method raise money purchase land.[74] The search coincided arrival Great Depression United States, money land purchase scarce.[75] The U.S. House Representatives authorized creation new national park May 30, 1934, passed rider ensured money allotted project least five years.[74] Coe's passion U.S. Senator Spessard Holland's politicking helped fully establish park, Holland able negotiate 1,300,000 acres (5,300km2) park, leaving Big Cypress, Key Largo, Turner River area, 22,000-acre (89km2) tract land called "The Hole Donut" highly valued agriculture. Miami Herald editor John Pennekamp instrumental pushing Florida Legislature raise $2million purchase private land inside park boundaries.[76] It dedicated President Harry Truman December 6, 1947, one month Marjorie Stoneman Douglas' book; "The Everglades: River Grass" released.[77] In year, several tropical storms struck South Florida, prompting construction 1,400 miles (2,300km) canals, sending water unwanted farmers residents ocean.[75] The park protects last stands pine rockland Florida. The Central Southern Florida Flood Control Project (CSF) authorized Congress construct thousand miles canals flood control structures across South Florida. The CSF, run U.S. Army Corps Engineers, established agricultural area directly south Lake Okeechobee, three water conservation areas, bordered canals diverted excess water either urban areas Atlantic Ocean, Gulf Mexico Florida Bay. South manmade regions Everglades National Park, effectively cut water supply. By 1960s, park visibly suffering. The CSF directed provide enough water sustain park, follow through.[78] A proposed airport dire environment effects Everglades National Park became center battle helped initiate environmental movement local national politics. The airport proposal eventually abandoned 1972 bill introduced curb development South Florida ensure national park receive amount water needed. Efforts turned repairing damage wrought decades mismanagement: Army Corps Engineers changed focus 1990 constructing dams canals constructing "purely environmental projects".[79] Regions originally included Ernest Coe's vision national park slowly added years park incorporated protected areas: Biscayne National Park, Big Cypress National Preserve, John Pennekamp Coral Reef State Park Key Largo, Ten Thousand Islands National Wildlife Refuge, Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary protected park's opening 1947. Everglades National Park designated International Biosphere Reserve October 26, 1976. On November 10, 1978, park declared wilderness area. Wilderness designations covered 1,296,505 acres (5,246.77km2) 2003—about 86percent park. It listed UNESCO World Heritage Site October 24, 1979, Wetland International Importance June 4, 1987.[4] It placed List World Heritage Danger 1993 2007 2010.[80] Restoration efforts[edit] Further information: Restoration Everglades A little blue heron hunting near water Anhinga Trail President George H. W. Bush signed Everglades National Park Protection Expansion Act December 13, 1989, added 109,506 acres (443.16km2) eastern side park, closed park airboats, directed Department Army restore water improve ecosystems within Everglades National Park, "Direct(ed) Secretary Interior manage Park order maintain natural abundance, diversity, ecological integrity native plants animals, well behavior native animals, part ecosystem."[81] Bush remarked statement signing act, "Through legislation river grass may restored natural flow water".[82] In 1993, park placed List World Heritage Danger. In 2000, Congress approved federal effort restore Everglades, named Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP), objectives "restoration, preservation protection south Florida ecosystem providing water-related needs region",[83] claiming largest environmental restoration history. It controversial plan; detractors worried "relies uncertain technologies, overlooks water quality, subsidizes damaging growth delays environmental benefits".[84] Supporters plan included National Audubon Society, accused Friends Everglades Biodiversity Legal Foundation prioritizing agricultural business interests.[84] The namesake Anhinga Trail dries feathers CERP projects designed capture 1.7billion US gallons (6,400,000m3) fresh water every day, store underground reservoirs release water areas within 16counties South Florida. Approximately 35,600 acres (144km2) man-made wetlands constructed confine contaminated water released Everglades, 240 miles (390km) canals divert water away Everglades destroyed.[85] During first five years implementation, CERP responsible purchase 207,000 acres (840km2) land cost $1billion. The plan aims spend $10.5billion 30years, combining 50 different projects giving 5-year timelines.[86] The State Florida invested $2 billion restoring Everglades, funds matched U.S. government.[87] As June 2008, U.S. government spent $400 million $7.8 billion legislated.[88] Initiatives aid Everglades restoration include U.S. Sugar Land Corp transaction, C-111 spreader canal Tamiami Trail bridging. These projects supported groups Everglades Foundation, whose mission aid efforts saving America's Everglades future generations.[89] In spite this, Everglades National Park removed 2007 List World Heritage Danger.[90] It listed List World Heritage Danger 2010.[91] The National Research Council reported September 2008 CERP projects completed, lack progress water deliveries Everglades National Park "is one discouraging stories Everglades restoration".[92] Everglades National Park directly hit Hurricanes Katrina, Wilma, Rita 2005. Such storms natural part park's ecosystem; 1960's Hurricane Donna left nothing mangroves "standing dead snags" several miles wide, 30years later area completely recovered.[23] Predictably, suffered park 2005 hurricanes manmade structures. In 2009 visitors' center lodge Flamingo irreparably damaged 125mph (201km/h) winds 8ft (2.4m) storm surge; lodge functioning 50 years torn down: nothing slated replace it.[93] Park economics[edit] Everglades National Park reported 2005 budget $28million. Of that, $14.8million granted National Park Service, $13.5million various sources including CERP, donations, grants.[94] The entry fee vehicles 2006 ranged $10 $200 bus tours. Of nearly one million visitors Everglades National Park 2006, 38,000 overnight campers, paying $16 night $10 night backcountry permits.[95] Visitors spent $2.6 million[94] within park $48million local economies.[96] More 900jobs sustained created within park, park added value $35million local economies.[96] Activities[edit] The busiest season visitors December March, temperatures lowest mosquitoes least active. The park features four visitor centers: Tamiami Trail (part U.S. Route 41) directly west Miami Shark Valley Visitor Center. A fifteen-mile (24km) round trip path leads center two-story observation tower. Tram tours available busy season. Closest Homestead State Road 9336 Ernest F. Coe Visitor Center, 38-mile (61km) road begins, winding pine rockland, cypress, freshwater marl prairie, coastal prairie, mangrove ecosystems. Various hiking trails accessible road, runs Flamingo Visitor Center marina, open staffed busier time year. The Gulf Coast Visitor Center closest Everglades City State Road 29 along west coast. The Gulf Coast Visitor Center gives canoers access Wilderness Waterway, 99-mile (160km) canoe trail extends Flamingo Visitor Center.[97] The western coast park Ten Thousand Islands various key islands Florida Bay accessible boat. Trails[edit] A view vast sawgrass expanse north Anhinga Trail gives visitors opportunity see freshwater slough close. Several walking trails park vary hiking difficulty Pine Island, visitors cross hardwood hammocks, pinelands, freshwater sloughs. Starting Royal Palm Visitor Center, Anhinga Trail half-mile self-guided tour sawgrass marsh visitors see alligators, marsh wading birds, turtles, bromeliads. Its proximity Homestead accessibility make one visited sites park. The nearby Gumbo Limbo Trail also self-guided, half mile long. It loops canopy hardwood hammocks include gumbo limbo, royal palms (Roystonea), strangler figs (Ficus aurea), variety epiphytes.[98] Twenty eight miles (45km) trails start near Long Pine Key campgrounds wind Long Pine Key, well-suited offroad cycling pine rocklands Marjory Stoneman Douglas Wilderness Area. Two boardwalks allow visitors walk cypress forest Pa-Hay-O-Kee, also features two-story overlook, another Mahogany Hammock (referring Swietenia mahagoni) takes hikers dense forest middle freshwater marl prairie.[99] Closer Flamingo, rugged trails take visitors mangrove swamps, along Florida Bay. Christian Point Trail, Snake Bight Trail, Rowdy Bend Trail Coastal Prairie Trail allow viewing shorebirds wading birds among mangroves. Portions trails may impassable depending time year, mosquitoes water levels. Ranger-led tours take place busier season only.[100] Camping recreation[edit] The campground Flamingo Camping available year-round Everglades National Park. Frontcountry camping, services, available Long Pine Key, close Ernest F. Coe Visitor Center, 108sites accessible car. Near Flamingo, 234campsites services also available. Recreational vehicle camping available sites, without necessary services. Backcountry permits required campsites along Wilderness Waterway, Gulf Coast sites, sites various keys. Several backcountry sites chickees; others beach ground sites.[101] Low-powered motorboats allowed park; majority salt water areas no-wake zones protect manatees marine animals harm. Jet skis, airboats, motorized personal watercraft prohibited. Many trails allow kayaks canoes. A state license required fishing; fresh water licenses sold park, salt water licenses may available. Swimming recommended park; water moccasins, snapping turtles (Chelydra serpentina), alligators crocodiles thrive fresh water. Sharks, barracuda, sharp dangerous coral plentiful salt water. Visibility kinds.[102] Everglades National Park important part Great Florida Birding Trail.[103] It great biodiversity many species birds bird watching bird photography also. Threats park ecology[edit] Diversion quality water[edit] Bromeliads flourish bald cypress trees great egret passes Less 50percent Everglades existed prior drainage attempts remains intact today. Populations wading birds dwindled 90percent original numbers 1940s 2000s.[104] The diversion water South Florida's still-growing metropolitan areas Everglades National Park's number one threat. In 1950s 1960s, 1,400 miles (2,300km) canals levees, 150gates spillways, 16pumping stations constructed direct water toward cities away Everglades. Low levels water leave fish vulnerable reptiles birds, sawgrass dries burn die off, turn kills apple snails animals wading birds feed upon.[97] Populations birds fluctuate; 2009, South Florida Water Management District claimed wading birds across South Florida increased 335percent.[105] Following three years higher numbers, The Miami Herald reported year populations wading birds within park decreased 29percent.[106] The west coast Florida relies desalinization fresh water; quantity demanded great land provide. Nitrates underground water system high levels mercury also impact quality fresh water park receives.[97] In 1998 Florida panther found dead Shark Water Slough, levels mercury high enough kill human.[107] Increased occurrences algal blooms red tide Biscayne Bay Florida Bay traced amounts controlled water released Lake Okeechobee.[108] The brochure given visitors Everglades National Park includes statement reads, "Freshwater flowing park engineered. With help pumps, floodgates, retention ponds along park's boundary, Everglades presently life support, alive diminished."[97] Urban encroachment[edit] A series levees park's eastern border marks line urban protected areas, development areas threatens park system. Florida still attracts nearly thousand new residents every day, building residential, commercial industrial zones near Everglades National Park stresses water balance ecosystems within park. On park's western border, Fort Myers, Naples Cape Coral expanding, system levees exists mark border.[109] National Geographic rated Everglades National Park Big Cypress National Preserve lowest-scoring parks North America, 32 100. Their scoring system rated 55parks terms sustainable tourism, destination quality, park management. The experts compiled results justified score stating: "Encroachment housing retail development thrown precious ecosystem tailspin, humankind doesn't back off, nothing left one country's amazing treasures".[110] Endangered threatened animals[edit] The American crocodile notable differences alligator. Habitat destruction vehicle collisions largest threats experiences. Thirty-six federally protected animals live park, face grave threats survival. In United States, American crocodile's habitat within South Florida. They overhunted hides. They protected today hunting, still threatened due habitat destruction injury vehicle collisions crossing roads reach waterways. About 1,000 crocodiles live Florida roughly 50 nests Everglades Biscayne National Parks.[111] Crocodile populations South Florida increased number alligators. Crocodiles reclassified "endangered" "threatened" United States 2007.[112] The Florida panther one endangered mammals earth. About 50 live wild, primarily Everglades Big Cypress Swamp. The biggest threats panther include habitat destruction human development, vehicle collisions, inbreeding due limited gene pool, parasites, diseases, mercury poisoning.[113] Four Everglade species sea turtle including Atlantic green sea turtle, Atlantic hawksbill, Atlantic loggerhead (Caretta caretta), Atlantic ridley (Lepidochelys kempii) endangered. Also, leatherback sea turtle (Dermochelys coriacea) threatened. Numbers difficult determine, since males juveniles return birthplace; females lay eggs location every year. Habitat loss illegal poaching destructive fishing practices biggest threats animals.[114] Two species birds park danger disappearing. The range Cape Sable seaside sparrow restricted Everglades National Park Big Cypress Swamp.[115] In 1981, 6,656 Cape Sable seaside sparrows reported park boundaries, surveys 10 years documented decline estimated 2,624 birds 2002.[116] Attempts return natural levels water park controversial; Cape Sable seaside sparrows nest foot ground, rising water levels may harm future populations, well threaten endangered snail kite.[117] The Everglades snail kite eats apple snails almost exclusively, Everglades location United States bird prey exists. There evidence population may increasing, loss habitat food sources keep estimated number birds several hundred.[118] The West Indian manatee upgraded endangered threatened. Collisions boats habitat loss still biggest threats.[119] Drought, fire, rising sea levels[edit] Fire naturally occurs lightning storms, takes heaviest toll water levels low. Hardwood hammock cypress trees susceptible heavy damage fire, may take decades grow back.[97] Peat built centuries marsh fires burn deep scars soil. In 2007, Fred Sklar South Florida Water Management District said: "An extreme drought viewed (as) almost catastrophic volcano. It reshape entire landscape. It take 1,000 years produce two inches peat, lose couple inches week."[120] Rising sea levels caused global warming another threat future park. Since 1932, ocean levels Key West steadily risen 0.7 feet (0.2m), disastrous consequences land close ocean.[121] It estimated within 500 years freshwater habitats Everglades National Park obliterated salt water, leaving northernmost portion Everglades.[needs update] Cost estimates raising replacing Tamiami Trail Alligator Alley bridges hundreds millions dollars.[122] Non-native species[edit] Further information: List invasive species Everglades Burmese pythons Florida An aerial view southwestern tip Everglades National Park The introduction non-native species South Florida considerable problem park. Many biological controls like weather, disease, consumers naturally limit plants native environments exist Everglades, causing many grow larger multiply far beyond average numbers native habitats. Approximately 26percent fish, reptiles, birds, mammal species South Florida exotic—more part U.S.—and region hosts one highest numbers exotic plant species world.[123] Species adapt aggressively conditions Everglades, spreading quickly competing native species sometimes threatened endangered, called "invasive". Thousands exotic plant species observed South Florida, usually introduced ornamental landscaping. Park staff eradicate invasive plants melaleuca tree (Melaleuca quinquenervia), Brazilian pepper (Schinus terebinthifolius), Old World climbing fern (Lygodium microphyllum).[124] Similarly, animals often find predators natural barriers reproduction Everglades originate, thus often reproduce quickly efficiently. Lobate lac scale insects (Paratachardina pseudolobata) kill shrubs plants hardwood hammocks. Bromeliad beetles (Metamasius callizona) destroy bromeliads ecosystems host.[125] Walking catfish (Clarias batrachus) deplete aquaculture stocks carry enteric septicemia.[126] The Florida Fish Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC) listed eight "Reptiles Concern", including Burmese python (Python molurus bivittatus), focusing large sizes aggressive natures, allowing licensed hunters kill listed animals protected areas sell meat hides.[127][128] Burmese pythons, two subspecies African rock pythons (Python sebae; northern southern), yellow anacondas (Eunectes notaeus) banned import U.S. 2012. U.S. Secretary Interior Ken Salazar announced ban imports invasive reptiles Everglades National Park.[129] Exotic species control falls management U.S. Fish Wildlife Service, compiling disseminating information invasive species since 1994. Control invasive species costs $500million year, 1,700,000 acres (6,900km2) land South Florida remain infested.[130] See also[edit] Dry Tortugas National Park List World Heritage Sites Danger Nike Missile Site HM-69 References[edit] ^ "Everglades National Park".
