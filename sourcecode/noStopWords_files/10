Because Berne Convention countries default grants copyright holders monopolistic control creations, copyright content must explicitly declared free, usually referencing inclusion licensing statements within work. Although great many different definitions regular everyday use, free content legally similar, like identical twin, open content. An analogy use rival terms free software open source, describe ideological differences rather legal ones.[3][4][5] For instance, Open Knowledge Foundation's Open Definition describes "open" synonymous definition free "Definition Free Cultural Works" (as also Open Source Definition Free Software Definition).[6] For free/open content movements recommend three Creative Commons licenses, CC BY, CC BY-SA, CC0.[7][8][9][10] Legal matters[edit] Copyright[edit] copyright Main article: Copyright Copyright legal concept, gives author creator work legal control duplication public performance work. In many jurisdictions, limited time period works enter public domain. Copyright laws balance rights creators intellectual artistic works rights others build upon works. During time period copyright author's work may copied, modified, publicly performed consent author, unless use fair use. Traditional copyright control limits use work author either pay royalties author usage authors content, limit use fair use. Secondly limits use content whose author cannot found.[11] Finally creates perceived barrier authors limiting derivative works, mashups collaborative content[12] Public domain[edit] public domain Main article: Public domain The public domain range creative works whose copyright expired, never established; well ideas facts[nb 1] ineligible copyright. A public domain work work whose author either relinquished public, longer claim control over, distribution usage work. As person may manipulate, distribute, otherwise utilize work, without legal ramifications. A work public domain released permissive licence may referred "copycenter".[13] Copyleft[edit] Main article: Copyleft copyleft Copyleft play word copyright describes practice using copyright law remove restrictions distributing copies modified versions work.[14] The aim copyleft use legal framework copyright enable non-author parties able reuse and, many licensing schemes, modify content created author. Unlike works public domain, author still maintains copyright material, however author granted non-exclusive license person distribute, often modify, work. Copyleft licenses require derivative works distributed terms, original copyright notices maintained. A symbol commonly associated copyleft reversal copyright symbol, facing way; opening C points left rather right. Unlike copyright symbol, copyleft symbol codified meaning.[15] Usage[edit] Projects provide free content exist several areas interest, software, academic literature, general literature, music, images, video, engineering. Technology reduced cost publication reduced entry barrier sufficiently allow production widely disseminated materials individuals small groups. Projects provide free literature multimedia content become increasingly prominent owing ease dissemination materials associated development computer technology. Such dissemination may costly prior technological developments. Media[edit] Creative Commons Main article: Creative Commons In media, includes textual, audio, visual content, free licensing schemes licenses made Creative Commons allowed dissemination works clear set legal permissions. Not Creative Commons’ licenses entirely free: permissions may range liberal general redistribution modification work restrictive redistribution-only licensing. Since February 2008, Creative Commons licenses entirely free carry badge indicating "approved free cultural works".[16] Repositories exist exclusively feature free material provide content photographs, clip art, music,[17] literature,.[18] While extensive reuse free content one website another website legal, usually sensible duplicate content problem. Wikipedia amongst well known databases user uploaded free content web. While vast majority content Wikipedia free content, copyrighted material hosted Fair-use criteria. Software[edit] OSI logo FSF logo Main article: Free open-source software Free open source software, also often referred open source software free software, maturing technology major companies utilising free software provide services technology end users technical consumers. The ease dissemination allowed increased modularity, allows smaller groups contribute projects well simplifying collaboration. Open source development models classified similar peer-recognition collaborative benefit incentives typified classical fields scientific research, social structures result incentive model decreasing production cost.[19] Given sufficient interest software component, using peer-to-peer distribution methods, distribution costs software may reduced, removing burden infrastructure maintenance developers. As distribution resources simultaneously provided consumers, software distribution models scalable, method feasible regardless number consumers. In cases, free software vendors may use peer-to-peer technology method dissemination.[20] In general, project hosting code distribution problem free projects number providers offer services free. Engineering technology[edit] Open source hardware logo Free content principles translated fields engineering, designs engineering knowledge readily shared duplicated, order reduce overheads associated project development. Open design principles applied engineering technological applications, projects mobile telephony, small-scale manufacture,[21] automotive industry,[22][23] even agricultural areas.[24] Technologies distributed manufacturing allow computer-aided manufacturing computer-aided design techniques able develop small-scale production components development new, repair existing, devices. Rapid fabrication technologies underpin developments, allow end users technology able construct devices pre-existing blueprints, using software manufacturing hardware convert information physical objects. Academia[edit] open access Main article: Open access (publishing) In academic work, majority works free, although percentage works open access growing rapidly. Open access refers online research outputs free restrictions access (e.g. access tolls) free many restrictions use (e.g. certain copyright license restrictions).[25] Authors may see open access publishing method expanding audience able access work allow greater impact publication, may support ideological reasons.[26][27][28] Open access publishers PLOS Biomed Central provide capacity review publishing free works; though publications currently common science humanities. Various funding institutions governing research bodies mandated academics must produce works open-access, order qualify funding, National Institutes Health, RCUK (effective 2016) EU (effective 2020).[29][30][31][32] At institutional level universities, Massachusetts Institute Technology (MIT), adopted open access publishing default introducing mandates.[33] Some mandates may permit delayed publication may charge researchers open access publishing.[34][35] Open content publication seen method reducing costs associated information retrieval research, universities typically pay subscribe access content published traditional means[10][36][37] whilst improving journal quality discouraging submission research articles reduced quality.[10] Subscriptions non-free content journals may expensive universities purchase, though article written peer-reviewed academics cost publisher. This led disputes publishers universities subscription costs, one occurred University California Nature Publishing Group.[38][39] For teaching purposes, universities, including MIT, provide freely available course content, lecture notes, video resources tutorials. This content distributed via Internet resources general public. Publication resources may either formal institution-wide program,[40] alternately via informal content provided individual academics departments. Legislation[edit] Any country law legal system, sustained legislation, set law-documents — documents containing statutory obligation rules, usually law created legislatures. In democratic country, law-document published open media content, principle free content; general explicit license attributed law-document, license must interpreted, implied license. Only countries explicit licenses law-documents, UK's Open Government Licence (a CC-BY compatible license). In countries, implied license comes proper rules (general laws rules copyright government works). The automatic protection provided Berne Convention apply law-documents: Article 2.4 excludes official texts automatic protection. It also possible "inherit" license context. The set country's law-documents made available national repositories. Examples law-document open repositories: LexML Brazil, Legislation.gov.uk, N-Lex EU countries. In general law-document offered one (open) official version, main one published government gazette. So, law-documents eventually inherit license expressed repository gazette contains it.
