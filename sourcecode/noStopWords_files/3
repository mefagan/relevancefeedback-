gulf atlantic coasts florida laguna del espíritu santo ("lake holy spirit").[2] area featured maps decades without explored. writer john grant forbes stated 1811, "the indians represent [the southern points] impenetrable; [british] surveyors, wreckers, coasters, means exploring beyond borders sea coast, mouths rivers".[3] british surveyor john gerard de brahm, mapped coast florida 1773, called area "river glades". marjory stoneman douglas linguist wallace mcmullen suggest cartographers substituted "ever" "river".[3][4] name "everglades" first appeared map 1823, although also spelled "ever glades" late 1851.[5] seminole call pa-hay-okee, meaning "grassy water."[4] region labeled "pa-hai-okee" american military map 1839, although earlier called "ever glades" throughout second seminole war.[3] 2007 survey geographers ary j. lamme raymond k. oldakowski found "glades" emerged distinct vernacular region florida. comprises interior areas southernmost gulf coast south florida, largely corresponding everglades itself. one sparsely populated areas state.[6] geology[edit] geology south florida, together warm, wet, subtropical climate, provides conditions well-suited large marshland ecosystem. layers porous permeable limestone create water-bearing rock soil affect climate, weather, hydrology south florida.[7] properties rock underneath everglades explained geologic history state. crust underneath florida one point part african region supercontinent gondwana. 300 millionyears ago, north america merged africa, connecting florida north america. volcanic activity centered eastern side florida covered prevalent sedimentary rock igneous rock. continental rifting began separate north america gondwana 180 millionyears ago.[8] florida part africa, initially water, cooler jurassic period, florida platform became shallow marine environment sedimentary rocks deposited. cretaceous period, florida remained tropical sea floor varying depths.[9] peninsula covered seawater least seven times since bedrock formed.[10] limestone aquifers[edit] fluctuating sea levels compressed numerous layers calcium carbonate, sand, shells. resulting permeable limestone formations developed 25million 70million years ago created floridan aquifer, serves main source fresh water northern portion florida. however, aquifer lies beneath thousands feet impermeable sedimentary rock lake okeechobee southern tip peninsula.[11] limestone formations south florida. source: u.s. geological survey five geologic formations make southern portion florida: tamiami formation, caloosahatchee formation, anastasia formation, miami limestone (or miami oolite), fort thompson formation. tamiami formation compression highly permeable light colored fossiliferous sands pockets quartz, 150 feet (46m) thick. named tamiami trail follows upper bedrock big cypress swamp, underlies southern portion everglades. tamiami formation lake okeechobee caloosahatchee formation, named river it. much less permeable, formation highly calcitic composed sandy shell marl, clay, sand. water underneath caloosahatchee formation typically mineralized. tamiami caloosahatchee formations developed pliocene epoch.[12][13] surrounding southern part lake okeechobee fort thompson formation, made dense, hard limestone, shells, sand. rain water less likely erode limestone form solution holes—smaller versions sinkholes intersect water table. formation beds generally impermeable.[14] underneath metropolitan areas palm beach county anastasia formation, composed shelly limestone, coquina, sand representing former mangrove salt marsh. anastasia formation much permeable filled pocks solution holes.[14] fort thompson anastasia formations, miami limestone (x), formed sangamon interglacial period.[15] geologic formations influence everglades miami limestone fort thompson formation. miami limestone forms floor lower everglades. miami limestone made ooids: tiny formations egg-shaped concentric shells calcium carbonate, formed around single grain sand. miami limestone formerly named miami oolite, comprises facies ooids fossilized bryozoan organisms.[16] unique structure some first material used housing early 20th-century south florida. composition sedimentary formation affects hydrology, plant life, wildlife it: rock especially porous stores water dry season everglades, chemical composition determines vegetation prevalent region. miami limestone also acts dam fort lauderdale coot bay.[17] metropolitan areas miami, fort lauderdale, west palm beach located rise elevation along eastern coast florida, called eastern coastal ridge, formed waves compressed ooids single formation. along western border big cypress swamp immokolee ridge (or immokolee rise), slight rise compressed sand divides runoff caloosahatchee river big cypress.[18] slight rise elevation sides everglades creates basin, forces water overflows lake okeechobee creep toward southwest.[19] miami limestone formation fort thompson limestone lies biscayne aquifer, surface aquifer serves miami metropolitan area's fresh water source. rainfall stored water everglades replenish biscayne aquifer directly.[15] rise sea levels occurred pleistocene approximately 17,000years ago, runoff water lake okeechobee slowed created vast marshland known everglades. slower runoff also created accumulation almost 18 feet (5.5 m) peat area. presence peat deposits, dated 5,000years ago, evidence widespread flooding occurred then.[20] hydrology[edit] predevelopment flow direction water lake okeechobee florida bay source: u.s. geological survey consistent everglades flooding fed extensive kissimmee, caloosahatchee, myakka, peace rivers central florida. kissimmee river broad floodplain empties directly lake okeechobee, 730 square miles (1,900km2) average depth 9 feet (2.7m), vast shallow lake.[21] soil deposits everglades basin indicate peat deposited land flooded consistently throughout year. calcium deposits left behind flooding shorter. deposits occur areas water rises falls depending rainfall, opposed water stored rock one year next. calcium deposits present limestone exposed.[22] area orlando tip florida peninsula one point single drainage unit. rainfall exceeded capacity lake okeechobee kissimmee river floodplain, spilled flowed southwestern direction empty florida bay. prior urban agricultural development florida, everglades began southern edge lake okeechobee flowed approximately 100 miles (160km), emptying gulf mexico. limestone shelf wide slightly angled instead narrow, deep channel characteristic rivers. vertical gradient lake okeechobee florida bay 2 inches (5.1cm) per mile, creating almost 60-mile (97km) wide expanse river travels half mile (0.8km) day.[23] slow movement broad, shallow river known sheetflow, gives everglades nickname, river grass. water leaving lake okeechobee may require months years reach final destination, florida bay. sheetflow travels slowly water typically stored one wet season next porous limestone substrate. ebb flow water shaped land every ecosystem south florida throughout everglades' estimated 5,000years existence. motion water defines plant communities animals adapt habitats food sources.[24] climate[edit] hurricane charley 2004 moving ashore south florida's gulf mexico coast climate south florida located across broad transition zone subtropical tropical climates (koppen cf aw). like regions climate type, two basic seasons – "dry season" (winter) runs november april, "wet season" (summer) runs may october. 70% annual rainfall south florida occurs wet season – often brief intense tropical downpours. dry season sees little rainfall dew points humidity often quite low. dry season severe times, wildfires water restrictions often place. annual range temperatures south florida everglades rather small (less 20°f [11°c]) – ranging monthly mean temperature around 65°f (18°c) january 83°f (28°c) july. high temperatures hot wet season (summer) typically exceed 90°f (32°c) across inland south florida (although coastal locations cooled winds gulf mexico atlantic ocean), high temperatures dry winter season average 70 79°f (21 26°c). frost freeze rare across south florida everglades; annually coastal cities like miami naples report zero days frost, although times decade low temperatures may fall 30 40°f (−1 4°c) across south florida. annual rainfall averages approximately 62 inches (160cm), eastern coastal ridge receiving majority precipitation area surrounding lake okeechobee receiving 48 inches (120cm).[25] unlike other wetland system earth, everglades sustained primarily atmosphere.[26] evapotranspiration – sum evaporation plant transpiration earth's land surface atmosphere – associated thunderstorms, key mechanism water leaves region. year unaffected drought, rate may reach 40 inches (100cm) year. droughts take place, rate may peak 50 inches (130cm), exceed amount rainfall.[27] water leaves area evaporation groundwater plant matter, activated primarily solar energy, moved wind patterns other areas border flow everglades watershed system. evapotranspiration responsible approximately 70–90percent water entering undeveloped wetland regions everglades.[28] precipitation wet season primarily caused air mass thunderstorms easterly flow subtropical high (bermuda high). intense daytime heating ground causes warm moist tropical air rise, creating afternoon thundershowers typical tropical climates. 2:00pm mean time daily thundershowers across south florida everglades. late wet season (august september), precipitation levels reach highest levels tropical depressions lows add daily rainfall. occasionally, tropical lows become severe tropical cyclones cause significant damage make landfall across south florida. tropical storms average one year, major hurricanes every ten years. 1871 1981, 138tropical cyclones struck directly close everglades.[25] strong winds storms disperse plant seeds replenish mangrove forests, coral reefs, other ecosystems. dramatic fluctuations precipitation characteristic south florida climate. droughts, floods, tropical cyclones part natural water system everglades.[28] average, maximum, minimum levels rainfall lower east coast florida, 1918 1985[25] period mean maximum minimum annual 51.9 inches (132cm) 77.5 inches

main article: geography ecology everglades everglades complex system interdependent ecosystems. marjory stoneman douglas described area "river grass" 1947, though metaphor represents portion system. area recognized everglades, prior drainage, web marshes prairies 4,000 square miles (10,000km2) size.[29] borders ecosystems subtle imperceptible. systems shift, grow shrink, die, reappear within years decades. geologic factors, climate, frequency fire help create, maintain, replace ecosystems everglades. water[edit] storm shark river everglades, 1966 photo:charles barron / state library archives florida water dominant force everglades, shaping land, vegetation, animal life south florida. starting last glacial maximum, 21,000 years ago, continental ice sheets retreated sea levels rose. submerged portions florida peninsula caused water table rise. fresh water saturated limestone underlies everglades, eroding some away, created springs sinkholes. abundance fresh water allowed new vegetation take root, formed convective thunderstorms land evaporation.[30][31] rain continued fall, slightly acidic rainwater dissolved limestone. limestone wore away, groundwater came contact land surface created massive wetland ecosystem.[30] although region appears flat, weathering limestone created slight valleys plateaus some areas. plateaus rise fall inches, subtle south florida topography small variations affect flow water types vegetation take hold.[32] rock[edit] uneven limestone formations everglades sawgrass prairie underlying bedrock limestone everglades basin affects hydroperiod, long area within region stays flooded throughout year.[30] longer hydroperiods possible areas submerged beneath seawater longer periods time, geology florida forming. water held within porous ooids limestone older types rock spent time sea level.[33] hydroperiod ten months fosters growth sawgrass, whereas shorter hydroperiod six months less promotes beds periphyton, growth algae other microscopic organisms. two types soil everglades, peat marl. longer hydroperiods, peat builds hundreds thousands years due many generations decaying plant matter.[34] periphyton grows, soil develops marl, calcitic composition. initial attempts developing agriculture near lake okeechobee successful, nutrients peat rapidly removed. process called soil subsidence, oxidation peat causes loss volume.[35] bacteria decompose dead sawgrass slowly underwater without oxygen. water drained 1920s bacteria interacted oxygen, aerobic reaction occurred. microorganisms degraded peat carbon dioxide water. some peat burned settlers clear land. some homes built areas early farms foundations moved stilts peat deteriorated; other areas lost approximately 8 feet (2.4m) soil depth.[36] fire[edit] fire important element natural maintenance everglades. majority fires caused lightning strikes thunderstorms wet season. effects largely superficial, serve foster specific plant growth: sawgrass burn water, roots preserved underneath. fire sawgrass marshes serves keep larger bushes trees, releases nutrients decaying plant matter efficiently decomposition.[37] whereas wet season, dead plant matter tips grasses trees burned, dry season fire may fed organic peat burn deeply, destroying root systems.[37] fires confined existing water rainfall. takes approximately 225years one foot (.30 m) peat develop, some locations peat less dense 5,000years everglades' existence.[38] scientists indicate fire cause; also cited reason black color everglades muck. layers charcoal detected peat portions everglades indicate region endured severe fires years time, although trend seems abated since last occurrence 940 bce.[38] ecosystems[edit] main article: geography ecology everglades major landscape types everglades human action. source: u.s. geological survey sawgrass marshes sloughs[edit] several ecosystems present everglades, boundaries subtle absent. primary feature everglades sawgrass marsh. iconic water sawgrass combination shallow river 100 miles (160km) long 60 miles (97km) wide spans lake okeechobee florida bay often referred "true everglades" "the glades".[39][40] prior first drainage attempts 1905, sheetflow occupied nearly third lower florida peninsula.[30] sawgrass thrives slowly moving water, may die unusually deep floods oxygen unable reach roots. particularly vulnerable immediately fire.[41] hydroperiod marsh least nine months, last longer.[42] sawgrass grows densely, animals other plants live, although alligators choose locations nesting. room, periphyton grows.[43] periphyton supports larval insects amphibians, turn consumed food birds, fish, reptiles. also absorbs calcium water, adds calcitic composition marl.[44] sloughs, free-flowing channels water, develop sawgrass prairies. sloughs 3 feet (0.91m) deeper sawgrass marshes, may stay flooded least 11months year sometimes multiple years row.[45] aquatic animals turtles, alligators, snakes, fish thrive sloughs; usually feed aquatic invertebrates.[46] submerged floating plants grow here, bladderwort (utricularia), waterlily (nymphaeaceae), spatterdock (nuphar lutea). major sloughs everglades system include shark river slough flowing florida bay, lostmans river slough bordering big cypress, taylor slough eastern everglades. wet prairies slightly elevated like sawgrass marshes, greater plant diversity. surface covered water three seven months year, water is, average, shallow 4 inches (10cm) deep.[47] flooded, marl support variety water plants.[48] solution holes, deep pits limestone worn away, may remain flooded even prairies dry, support aquatic invertebrates crayfish snails, larval amphibians feed young wading birds.[49] regions tend border sloughs sawgrass marshes. alligators created niche wet prairies. claws snouts dig low spots create ponds free vegetation remain submerged throughout dry season. alligator holes integral survival aquatic invertebrates, turtles, fish, small mammals, birds extended drought periods. alligators feed upon some animals come hole.[50][51] tropical hardwood hammock[edit] tropical hardwood hammock, trees dense diverse. main article: tropical hardwood hammock small islands trees growing land raised 1 foot (0.30m) 3 feet (0.91m) sloughs prairies called tropical hardwood hammocks.[52] may range one (4,000m²) ten acres (40,000m²) area, appear freshwater sloughs, sawgrass prairies, pineland. hammocks slightly elevated limestone plateaus risen several inches surrounding peat, may grow land unharmed deep peat fires. hardwood hammocks exhibit mixture subtropical hardwood trees, southern live oak (quercus virginiana), gumbo limbo (bursera simaruba), royal palm (roystonea), bustic (dipholis salicifolia) grow dense clumps.[53] near base, sharp saw palmettos (serenoa repens) flourish, making hammocks difficult people penetrate, though small mammals, reptiles amphibians find islands ideal habitat. water sloughs flows around islands, creating moats. though some ecosystems maintained promoted fire, hammocks may take decades centuries recover. moats around hammocks protect trees.[54] trees limited height weather factors frost, lightning, wind; majority trees hammocks grow higher 55 feet (17m). pineland[edit] some driest land everglades pineland (also called pine rockland) ecosystem, located highest part everglades little hydroperiod. some floors, however, may flooded solution holes puddles months time. significant feature pineland single species south florida slash pine (pinus elliottii). pineland communities require fire maintain them, trees several adaptations simultaneously promote resist fire.[55] sandy floor pine forest covered dry pine needles highly flammable. south florida slash pines insulated bark protect heat. fire eliminates competing vegetation forest floor, opens pine cones germinate seeds.[56] period without significant fire turn pineland hardwood hammock larger trees overtake slash pines.[57] understory shrubs pine rocklands fire-resistant saw palmetto (serenoa repens), cabbage palm (sabal palmetto), west indian lilac (tetrazygia bicolor). diverse group plants pine community herbs, two dozen species. plants contain tubers other mechanisms allow sprout quickly charred.[58] prior urban development south florida region, pine rocklands covered approximately 161,660 acres (654.2km2) miami-dade county. within everglades national park, 19,840 acres (80.3km2) pine forests protected, outside park, 1,780 acres (7.2km2) pine communities remained 1990, averaging 12.1 acres (49,000m2) area.[55] misunderstanding role fire also played part disappearance pine forests area, natural fires put pine rocklands transitioned hardwood hammocks. prescribed fires occur everglades national park pine rocklands every three seven years.[59] cross section fresh water ecosystems everglades, relative average water depths cypress[edit] pond big cypress cypress swamps found throughout everglades, largest covers collier county. big cypress swamp located west sawgrass prairies sloughs, commonly called "the big cypress."[60] name refers area rather height diameter trees; conservative estimate, swamp measures 1,200 square miles (3,100km2), hydrologic boundary big cypress calculated 2,400 square miles (6,200km2).[61] big cypress sits atop bedrock covered thinner layer limestone. limestone underneath big cypress contains quartz, creates sandy soil hosts variety vegetation different found other areas everglades.[60] basin big cypress receives average 55 inches (140cm) water wet season.[62] though big cypress largest growth cypress swamps south florida, cypress swamps found near atlantic coastal ridge lake okeechobee eastern flatwoods, well sawgrass marshes. cypresses deciduous conifers uniquely adapted thrive flooded conditions, buttressed trunks root projections protrude water, called "knees".[63] bald cypress trees grow formations tallest thickest trunks center, rooted deepest peat. peat thins out, cypresses grow smaller thinner, giving small forest appearance dome outside.[64] also grow strands, slightly elevated ridge limestone bordered either side sloughs.[65] other hardwood trees found cypress domes, red maple, swamp bay, pop ash. cypresses removed, hardwoods take over, ecosystem recategorized mixed swamp forest. mangrove coastal prairie[edit] red mangrove trees bordering tidal estuary everglades eventually water lake okeechobee big cypress makes way ocean. mangrove trees well adapted transitional zone brackish water fresh salt water meet.[66] estuarine ecosystem ten thousand islands, comprised almost completely mangrove forests, covers almost 200,000 acres (810km2).[67] wet season fresh water pours florida bay, sawgrass begins grow closer coastline. dry season, particularly extended periods drought, salt water creeps inland coastal prairie, ecosystem buffers freshwater marshes absorbing sea water. mangrove trees begin grow fresh water ecosystems salt water goes far enough inland.[68] three species trees considered mangroves: red (rhizophora mangle), black (avicennia germinans), white (laguncularia racemosa), although different families.[69] grow oxygen-poor soil, survive drastic water level changes, tolerant salt, brackish, fresh water.[70] three mangrove species integral coastline protection severe storms. red mangroves farthest-reaching roots, trapping sediments help build coastlines storms. three types trees absorb energy waves storm surges. everglades mangroves also serve nurseries crustaceans fish, rookeries birds. region supports tortugas pink shrimp (farfantepenaeus duorarum) stone crab (menippe mercenaria) industries;[71] 80 90 percent commercially harvested crustacean species florida's salt waters born spend time near everglades.[67][72] florida bay[edit] main article: florida bay clump mangroves distance, florida bay flamingo much coast inner estuaries built mangroves; border coastal marshes bay. thus marine ecosystems florida bay considered part everglades watershed one ecosystems connected affected everglades whole. 800 square miles (2,100km2) florida bay protected everglades national park, representing largest body water park boundaries.[73] approximately 100 keys florida bay, many mangrove forests.[74] fresh water coming florida bay everglades creates perfect conditions vast beds turtle grass algae formations foundation animal life bay. sea turtles manatees eat grass, invertebrate animals, worms, clams other mollusks eat algae formations microscopic plankton.[75] female sea turtles return annually nest shore, manatees spend winter months warmer water bay. sea grasses also serve stabilize sea beds protect shorelines erosion absorbing energy waves. history[edit] native americans[edit] main article: indigenous people everglades region humans arrived florida peninsula approximately 15,000years ago. paleo-indians came florida probably following large game included giant sloths, saber-toothed cats, spectacled bears. found arid landscape supported plants animals adapted desert conditions.[76] however, 6,500years ago, climate changes brought wetter landscape; large animals became extinct florida, paleo-indians slowly adapted became archaic peoples. conformed environmental changes, created many tools various resources available.[77] late archaic period, climate became wetter again, approximately 3000 bce rise water tables allowed increase population cultural activity. florida indians developed three distinct similar cultures named bodies water near located: okeechobee, caloosahatchee, glades.[78] calusa tequesta[edit] main articles: calusa tequesta glades peoples, two major nations emerged area: calusa tequesta. calusa largest powerful nation south florida. controlled fifty villages located florida's west coast, around lake okeechobee, florida keys. calusa villages located mouths rivers key islands. calusa hunter-gatherers lived small game, fish, turtles, alligators, shellfish, various plants.[79] tools made bone teeth, although sharpened reeds also effective hunting war. calusa weapons consisted bows arrows, atlatls, spears. canoes used transportation, south florida tribes often canoed everglades, rarely lived them.[80] canoe trips cuba also common.[81] estimated numbers calusa beginning spanish occupation ranged 4,000 7,000.[82] society declined power population; 1697 number estimated 1,000.[81] early 18th century, calusa came attack yamasee north. asked spanish refuge cuba, almost 200 died illness. soon relocated florida keys.[83] second power number calusa south florida tequesta. occupied southeastern portion lower peninsula modern-day dade broward counties. like calusa, tequesta societies centered mouths rivers. main village probably miami river little river. spanish depictions tequesta state greatly feared sailors, suspected torturing killing survivors shipwrecks.[84] increasing european presence south florida, native americans keys other areas began increasing trips cuba. official permission immigration native americans florida keys granted cuban officials 1704.[85] spanish priests attempted set missions 1743, noted tequesta assault neighboring tribe. 30members left, removed havana. british surveyor 1770 described multiple deserted villages region tequesta lived.[86] common descriptions native americans florida 1820 used term "seminoles".[87] seminole[edit] main article: seminole seminoles made home everglades following demise calusa tequesta, native americans southern florida referred "spanish indians" 1740s, probably due friendlier relations spain. creek invaded florida peninsula; conquered assimilated left pre-columbian societies creek confederacy. joined remnant indian groups formed seminole, new tribe, ethnogenesis. seminole originally settled northern portion territory. addition, free blacks fugitive slaves made way florida, spain promised slaves freedom arms converted catholicism pledged loyalty spain. african americans gradually created communities near seminole, became known black seminoles. groups acted allies. 1817, andrew jackson invaded florida hasten annexation united states, became known first seminole war. florida became u.s. territory 1821, conflicts settlers seminole increased former tried

conflict broke third seminole war 1855 1859, hundred seminole fought us forces swamps everglades. us finally decided leave alone, could dislodge even protracted expensive warfare. 1913, seminole everglades numbered 325.[89] made living hunting trading white settlers, raised domesticated animals.[90] seminole made villages hardwood hammocks pinelands, diets hominy coontie roots, fish, turtles, venison, small game.[89] villages large, due limited size hammocks. end last seminole war 1930, people lived relative isolation majority culture. construction tamiami trail, beginning 1928 spanning region tampa miami, altered ways life. some began work local farms, ranches, souvenir stands.[91] some people interacted european americans began move reservations 1940s. bases reorganizing government became federally recognized 1957 seminole tribe florida. people kept traditional ways settlements along tamiami trail tended speak mikasuki language. later federally recognized 1962 miccosukee tribe indians florida. metropolitan areas south florida began grow, two groups closely associated everglades. struggled maintain privacy serving tourist attractions. earned money wrestling alligators selling craftworks.[92] 2008, seminole tribe florida five reservations, lands miccosukee tribe indians collectively considered sixth reservation. two tribes developed casino gaming some properties generate revenue support, services economic development.[93] exploration[edit] map everglades 1856: military action seminole wars improved understanding features everglades main article: draining development everglades military penetration southern florida offered opportunity map poorly understood largely unknown part country. 1840 expedition everglades offered first printed account general public read everglades. anonymous writer described terrain party crossing: "no country ever heard bears resemblance it; seems like vast sea filled grass green trees, expressly intended retreat rascally indian, white man would never seek drive them".[94] land seemed inspire extreme reactions wonder hatred. second seminole war army surgeon wrote, "it fact hideous region live in, perfect paradise indians, alligators, serpents, frogs, every other kind loathsome reptile."[95] 1897, explorer hugh willoughby spent eight days canoeing party mouth harney river miami river. sent observations new orleans times-democrat. willoughby described water healthy wholesome, numerous springs, 10,000alligators "more less" lake okeechobee. party encountered thousands birds near shark river, "killing hundreds, continued return".[96] willoughby pointed much rest country explored mapped except part florida, writing, "(w)e tract land one hundred thirty miles long seventy miles wide much unknown white man heart africa."[97] drainage[edit] national push expansion progress united states occurred later part 19th century, stimulated interest draining everglades agricultural use. according historians, "from middle nineteenth century middle twentieth century, united states went period wetland removal questioned. indeed, considered proper thing do."[98] draining everglades suggested early 1837,[5] resolution congress passed 1842 prompted secretary treasury robert j. walker request experience everglades give opinion possibility drainage. many officers served seminole wars favored idea.[5] 1850 congress passed law gave several states wetlands within state boundaries. swamp overflowed lands act ensured state would responsible funding attempts developing wetlands farmlands.[99] florida quickly formed committee consolidate grants pay attempts, though civil war reconstruction halted progress 1877. hamilton disston's land sale notice civil war, state agency called internal improvement fund (iif), whose purpose improve florida's roads, canals, rail lines, discovered deeply debt. iif found pennsylvania real estate developer named hamilton disston interested implementing plans drain land agriculture. disston purchased 4,000,000 acres (16,000km2) land $1 million 1881,[100] began constructing canals near st. cloud. first canals seemed work lowering water levels wetlands surrounding rivers.[101] effective lowering groundwater, became apparent capacity insufficient wet season.[102] though disston's canals drain well, purchase primed economy florida. made news attracted tourists land buyers. within four years property values doubled, population increased significantly.[100] iif able invest development projects due disston's purchase, opportunity improve transportation arose oil tycoon henry flagler began purchasing land building rail lines along east coast florida, far south palm beach 1893.[103] along way built resort hotels, transforming territorial outposts tourist destinations. land bordering rail lines developed citrus farms.[104] 1896 rail line extended biscayne bay.[105] three months first train arrived, residents miami voted incorporate town. miami became prime destination extremely wealthy people royal palm hotel opened.[106] 1904 gubernatorial race, strongest candidate, napoleon bonaparte broward, promoted draining everglades. called future south florida "empire everglades". soon successful election, began work "drain abominable pestilence-ridden swamp",[107] pushed florida legislature form group commissioners oversee reclamation flooded lands. 1907 established everglades drainage district began study build effective canals, fund them.[5] governor broward ran u.s. senate 1908 lost. broward paid land developer richard j. bolles tour state promote drainage. elected senate 1910, broward died could take office. land everglades sold $15 acre month broward died.[108] meanwhile, henry flagler continued build railway stations towns soon populations warranted them.[105] growth urban areas[edit] canal lock everglades drainage district around 1915 construction canals, newly reclaimed everglades land promoted throughout united states. land developers sold 20,000lots months 1912. advertisements promised within eight weeks arrival, farmer could making living, although many took least two months clear land. some tried burning sawgrass other vegetation, learn peat continued burn. animals tractors used plowing got mired muck useless. muck dried, turned fine black powder created dust storms.[109] though initially crops sprouted quickly lushly, quickly wilted died, seemingly without reason.[110] increasing population towns near everglades hunted area. raccoons otters widely hunted skins. hunting often went unchecked; one trip, lake okeechobee hunter killed 250alligators 172otters.[111] water birds particular target plume hunting. bird feathers used women's hats late 19th early 20th centuries. 1886, 5million birds estimated killed feathers.[112] shot usually spring, feathers colored mating nesting. plumes, aigrettes, called millinery business, sold $32 ounce 1915— price gold.[111] millinery $17million year industry[113] motivated plume harvesters lay watch nests egrets many colored birds nesting season, shoot parents small-bore rifles, leave chicks starve.[111] plumes everglades wading birds could found havana, new york city, london, paris. hunters could collect plumes hundred birds good day.[114] rum-runners used everglades hiding spot prohibition; vast never enough law enforcement officers patrol it.[115] arrival railroad, discovery adding trace elements like copper remedy crops sprouting dying quickly, soon created population boom. new towns moore haven, clewiston, belle glade sprouted like crops.[5] sugarcane became primary crop grown south florida. miami experienced second real estate boom earned developer coral gables $150million. undeveloped land north miami sold $30,600 acre.[116] 1925, miami newspapers published editions weighing 7 pounds (3.2kg), real estate advertising.[117] waterfront property highly valued. mangrove trees cut replaced palm trees improve view. acres south florida slash pine cleared. some pine lumber, pine forests dade county cleared development.[55] flood control[edit] sign advertising completion herbert hoover dike two catastrophic hurricanes 1926 1928 caused lake okeechobee breach levees, killing thousands people. government began focus control floods rather drainage. okeechobee flood control district created 1929, financed state federal funds. president herbert hoover toured towns affected 1928 okeechobee hurricane ordered army corps engineers assist communities surrounding lake.[118] 1930 1937 dike 66 miles (106km) long built around southern edge lake. control hoover dike waters lake okeechobee delegated federal powers: united states declared legal limits lake 14 17 feet (4.3 5.2m).[97] massive canal also constructed 80 feet (24m) wide 6 feet (1.8m) deep caloosahatchee river; whenever lake rose high, excess water left canal.[97] $20million spent entire project. sugarcane production soared dike canal built. populations small towns surrounding lake jumped 3,000 9,000 world war ii.[119] immediately effects hoover dike seen. extended drought occurred 1930s; wall preventing water leaving lake okeechobee canals ditches removing other water, everglades became parched. peat turned dust. salt ocean water intruded miami's wells; city brought expert explain why, discovered water everglades area's groundwater—here, appeared surface.[120] 1939, million acres (4,000km²) everglades burned, black clouds peat sawgrass fires hung miami.[121] scientists took soil samples draining take account organic composition peat muck everglades make prone soil subsidence becomes dry. naturally occurring bacteria everglades peat muck assist process decomposition water, generally slow, partially due low levels dissolved oxygen. water levels became low peat muck surface, bacteria interacted much higher levels oxygen air, rapidly breaking soil. some places, homes moved stilts 8 feet (2.4m) soil lost.[36] everglades national park[edit] president harry truman dedicating everglades national park december 6, 1947. main article: everglades national park idea national park everglades pitched 1928, miami land developer named ernest f. coe established everglades tropical national park association. enough support declared national park congress 1934. took another 13years dedicated december 6, 1947.[122] one month dedication park, former editor miami herald freelance writer named marjory stoneman douglas released first book titled everglades: river grass. researching region five years, described history ecology south florida great detail. characterized everglades river instead stagnant swamp.[123] last chapter titled, "the eleventh hour" warned everglades dying, although could reversed.[124] central southern florida flood control project[edit] year park dedicated, two hurricanes wet season caused 100 inches (250cm) fall south florida. though human casualties, agricultural interests lost approximately $59million.[125] 1948 congress approved central southern florida project flood control other purposes (csf), divided everglades basins. northern everglades water conservation areas (wcas), everglades agricultural area (eaa) bordering south lake okeechobee. southern everglades everglades national park. levees pumping stations bordered wca, released water dryer times removed pumped ocean times flood. wcas took approximately 37percent original everglades.[126] csf constructed 1,000 miles (1,600km) canals, hundreds pumping stations levees within three decades. 1950s 1960s miami metropolitan area grew four times fast rest nation. 1940 1965, 6million people moved south florida: 1,000people moved miami every week.[127] developed areas mid-1950s late 1960s quadrupled. much water reclaimed everglades sent newly developed areas.[128] everglades agricultural area[edit] see also: draining_and_development_of_the_everglades §everglades_agricultural_area 2003 u.s. geological survey photo showing border water conservation area 3 (bottom) water, everglades national park, dry (top) csf established 470,000 acres (1,900km2) everglades agricultural area—27percent everglades prior development.[129] late 1920s, agricultural experiments indicated adding large amounts manganese sulfate everglades muck produced profitable harvest vegetables.[130] primary cash crop eaa sugarcane, though sod, beans, lettuce, celery, rice also grown. fields eaa typically 40 acres (160,000m2), bordered canals two sides, connected larger canals water pumped depending needs crops.[131] fertilizers used vegetables, along high concentrations nitrogen phosphorus byproduct decayed soil necessary sugarcane production, pumped wcas south eaa. introduction large amounts chemicals provided opportunities exotic plants take hold everglades.[132] one defining characteristics natural everglades ecology ability support nutrient-poor environment, introduction fertilizers began alter plant life region.[133] jetport proposition[edit] turning point came development everglades proposition expanded airport miami international airport outgrew capacities. new jetport planned larger o'hare, dulles, jfk, lax airports combined, chosen location 6 miles (9.7km) north everglades national park. first sentence u.s. department interior study environmental impact jetport read, "development proposed jetport attendant facilities... inexorably destroy south florida ecosystem thus everglades national park".[134] studies indicated proposed jetport would create 4,000,000 us gallons (15,000,000l) raw sewage day 10,000 short tons (9,100t) jet engine pollutants year, project met staunch opposition. new york times called "blueprint disaster",[135] wisconsin senator gaylord nelson wrote president richard nixon voicing opposition: "it test whether really committed country protecting environment."[136] governor claude kirk withdrew support project, marjory stoneman douglas persuaded 79years old go tour give hundreds speeches it. nixon instead established big cypress national preserve, announcing special message congress outlining 1972 environmental program .[137] restoration[edit] main article: restoration everglades kissimmee river[edit] central southern florida flood control project's final construction project straightening kissimmee river, meandering 90-mile (140km)-long river drained make way grazing land agriculture. csf started building c-38 canal 1962 effects seen almost immediately. waterfowl, wading birds, fish disappeared, prompting conservationists sport fishers demand region restored canal finished 1971.[138] general, csf projects criticized temporary fixes ignored future consequences, costing billions dollars end sight.[139] governor bob graham initiated save everglades campaign 1983, first section canal backfilled 1986. graham announced 2000 everglades would restored closely possible pre-drainage state.[140] kissimmee river restoration project approved congress 1992. estimated cost $578million convert 22 miles (35km) canal. entire project complete 2011,[141] yet 2017, project "more halfway complete" new completion date 2020. [142] water quality[edit] warnings placed everglades national park dissuade people eating fish due high mercury content. problems environment arose vast algal bloom appeared one-fifth lake okeechobee 1986. year cattails discovered overtaking sawgrass marshes loxahatchee national wildlife refuge. scientists discovered phosphorus, used fertilizer eaa, flushed canals pumped back lake.[143] lake drained, phosphorus entered water marshes, changing nutrient levels. kept periphyton forming marl, one two soils everglades. arrival phosphorus allowed cattails spread quickly. cattails grew dense mats—too thick birds alligators nest in. also dissolved oxygen peat, promoted algae, prohibited growth native invertebrates bottom food chain.[144] time mercury found local fish high levels consumption warnings posted fishermen. florida panther found dead levels mercury high enough kill human.[145] scientists found power plants incinerators using fossil fuels expelling mercury atmosphere, fell rain dust droughts. naturally occurring bacteria reduce sulfur everglades ecosystem transforming mercury methylmercury, bioaccumulating food chain.[145] stricter emissions standards helped lower mercury coming power plants incinerators, turn lowered mercury levels found animals, though continue concern.[145] everglades forever act, introduced governor lawton chiles 1994, attempt legislate lowering phosphorus everglades waterways. act put south florida water management district (sfwmd) florida department environmental protection (dep) charge testing enforcing low phosphorus levels: 10parts per billion (ppb) (down 500ppb 1980s).[146] sfwmd built stormwater treatment areas (stas) near sugarcane fields water leaving eaa flows ponds lined lime rock layers peat calcareous periphyton. testing shown method effective previously anticipated, bringing levels 80ppb 10ppb.[147] invasive species[edit] main article: list invasive species everglades climbing ferns overtake cypress trees everglades. ferns act "fire ladders" destroy trees would otherwise survive fires. center trade travel u.s., caribbean, south america, south florida especially vulnerable invasive species, species plants animals adapt aggressively conditions everglades, allowing reproduce faster grow larger would naturally native environments. approximately 26% species fish, reptiles, birds, mammals south florida exotic—more other part u.s.—and region hosts one highest numbers exotic plant species world.[148] controlling invasive species 1,700,000 acres (6,900km2) infested land south florida costs authorities $500 million year.[149] everglades hosts 1,392 exotic plant species actively reproducing region, outnumbering 1,301 species considered native south florida.[150] melaleuca tree (melaleuca quinquenervia) takes water greater amounts other trees. melaleucas grow taller densely everglades native australia, making unsuitable nesting areas birds wide wingspans.[151] also choke native vegetation. $2million spent keeping everglades national park.[152] brazilian pepper, florida holly (schinus terebinthifolius), also wreaked havoc everglades, exhibiting tendency spread rapidly crowd native species plants well create inhospitable environments native animals. especially difficult eradicate readily propagated birds, eat small red berries.[153] brazilian pepper problem exclusive everglades; neither water hyacinth (eichhornia crassipes), widespread problem florida's waterways, major threat endemic species, difficult costly eradicate. old world climbing fern (lygodium microphyllum) may causing harm restoration blankets areas thickly, making impossible animals pass through. also climbs trees creates "fire ladders", allowing parts trees burn would otherwise remain unharmed.[154] many pets escaped released everglades surrounding urban areas. some find conditions quite favorable established self-sustaining populations, competing food space native animals. many tropical fish released, blue tilapias (oreochromis aureus) cause damage shallow waterways creating large nests consuming aquatic plants protect native young fish.[155] native southern asia, burmese python (python molurus bivittatus) relatively new invasive species everglades. species grow 20 feet (6.1m) long, compete alligators top food chain. florida wildlife officials speculate escaped pythons begun reproducing environment well-suited.[156][157] everglades national park alone, agents removed 2,000 burmese pythons park 2017 [158]. federal authorities banned four species exotic snakes, including burmese python, 2012.[159] pythons believed responsible drastic decreases populations some mammals within park.[160] invasive species causes damage bird populations cat (felis catus), domestic feral. cats let outside live close suburban populations estimated number 640per square mile. close numbers historic migratory areas, devastating effects migratory bird populations.[161] comprehensive everglades restoration plan[edit] main article: comprehensive everglades restoration plan though scientists made headway decreasing mercury phosphorus levels water, natural environment south florida continued decline 1990s, life nearby cities reflected downturn. address deterioration miami metropolitan area, governor lawton chiles commissioned report sustainability area. 1995, chiles published commission's findings report related degradation everglades ecosystems lower quality life urban areas. report noted past environmental abuses brought state position make decision. acting improve south florida ecosystem, report predicted, would inevitably cause intolerable deterioration would harm local tourism 12,000jobs $200million annually, commercial fishing 3,300jobs $52million annually.[162] urban areas grown beyond capacities sustain themselves. crowded cities facing problems high crime rates, traffic jams, severely overcrowded schools, overtaxed public services; report noted water shortages ironic, given 53 inches (130cm) rain region received annually.[162] 1999, evaluation csf submitted congress part water development act 1992. seven-year report, called "restudy", cited indicators harm ecosystem: 50percent reduction original everglades, diminished water storage, harmful timing water releases canals pumping stations, 85 90percent decrease wading bird populations past 50years, decline output commercial fisheries. bodies water including lake okeechobee, caloosahatchee river, st. lucie estuary, lake worth lagoon, biscayne bay, florida bay everglades reflected drastic water level changes, hypersalinity, dramatic changes marine freshwater ecosystems. restudy noted overall decline water quality past 50years due loss wetlands act filters polluted water.[163] predicted without intervention entire south florida ecosystem would deteriorate. water shortages would become common some cities would annual water restrictions.[164] planned water recovery storage implementation using cerp strategies restudy came plan stop declining environmental quality, proposal expensive comprehensive ecological repair project history.[165] comprehensive everglades restoration plan (cerp) proposed 60construction projects 30years store water flushed ocean, reservoirs, underground aquifers, abandoned quarries; add stormwater treatment areas filter water flowed lower everglades; regulate water released pumping stations local waterways improve water released everglades national park water conservation areas; remove barriers sheetflow raising tamiami trail destroying miami canal, reuse wastewater urban areas.[166] cost estimate entire plan $7.8billion, bipartisan show cooperation, cerp voted congress overwhelming margin. signed president bill clinton december 11, 2000.[167] since signing, state florida reports spent $2billion various projects. 36,000 acres (150km2) stormwater treatment areas constructed filter 2,500 short tons (2,300t) phosphorus everglades waters. sta spanning 17,000 acres (69km2) constructed 2004, making largest manmade wetland world. fifty-five percent land necessary acquire restoration purchased state florida, totaling 210,167 acres (850.52km2). plan hasten construction funding projects put place, named "acceler8", spurring start six eight large construction projects, including three large reservoirs.[168] however, federal funds forthcoming; cerp signed u.s. government budget surplus, since deficits renewed, two cerp's major supporters congress retired. according story new york times, state officials say restoration lost maze "federal bureaucracy, victim 'analysis paralysis'".[169] cerp still remains controversial projects slated acceler8, environmental activists note, benefit urban areas, regions everglades desperate need water still neglected, suggesting water diverted make room people already overtaxed environment.[170] airboating become popular ecotourism attraction everglades series biennial reports u.s. national research council reviewed progress cerp. fourth report series, released 2012, found little progress made restoring core remaining everglades ecosystem; instead, project construction far occurred along periphery.[171] report noted reverse ongoing ecosystem declines, necessary expedite restoration projects target central everglades, improve quality quantity water ecosystem.[172] better understand potential implications current slow pace progress, report assessed current status ten everglades ecosystem attributes, including phosphorus loads, peat depth, populations snail kites, birds prey endangered south florida. attributes received grades ranging c (degraded) (significantly degraded), snail kite received grade f (near irreversible damage). report also assessed future trajectory ecosystem attribute three restoration scenarios: improved water quality, improved hydrology, improvements water quality hydrology, helped highlight urgency restoration actions benefit wide range ecosystem attributes demonstrate cost inaction.[172] overall, report concluded substantial near-term progress address water quality hydrology central everglades needed reverse ongoing degradation late. air crashes[edit] least three airplanes crashed everglades including: northwest orient airlines flight 705 (in 1963), eastern air lines flight 401 (1972), valujet flight 592 (1996). future everglades[edit] 2008, state florida agreed buy u.s. sugar manufacturing production facilities estimated $1.7billion.[173] florida officials indicated intended allow u.s. sugar process six years dismissing employees dismantling plant. area, includes 187,000 acres (760km2) land, would rehabilitated water flow lake okeechobee would restored.[173] november 2008, agreement revised offer $1.34billion, allowing sugar mills clewiston remain production.[174] critics revised plan say ensures sugarcane grown everglades least another decade.[175] research done address continuing production sugarcane everglades minimize phosphorus runoff.[176] everglades restoration received $96 million american recovery reinvestment act 2009.[177] result stimulus package, mile-long (1.6km) bridge replace tamiami trail, road borders everglades national park north blocked water reaching southern everglades, begun army corps engineers december 2009. next month work began reconstruct c-111 canal, east park historically diverted water florida bay.[178][179] governor charlie crist announced month $50 million state funds would earmarked everglades restoration.[180] may 2010, 5.5 miles (8.9km) bridges proposed added tamiami trail.[181] see also[edit] wikimedia commons media related everglades. florida portal carr (landform) everglades foundation everglades pseudoatoll history florida notes references[edit] ^ u.s. geological survey (1999).
