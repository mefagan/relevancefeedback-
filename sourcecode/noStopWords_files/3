native calusa tequesta tribes. spanish colonization, tribes declined gradually following two centuries. seminole formed mostly creek people warring north; assimilated other peoples created new culture. forced northern florida everglades seminole wars early 19th century, adapted region able resist removal united states army. migrants region wanted develop plantations first proposed draining everglades 1848, work type attempted 1882. canals constructed throughout first half 20th century, spurred south florida economy, prompting land development. 1947, congress formed central southern florida flood control project, built 1,400 miles (2,300km) canals, levees, water control devices. miami metropolitan area grew substantially time everglades water diverted cities. portions everglades transformed farmland, primary crop sugarcane. approximately 50percent original everglades developed agricultural urban areas.[1] following period rapid development environmental degradation, ecosystem

gulf atlantic coasts florida laguna del esp√≠ritu santo ("lake holy spirit").[2] area featured maps decades without explored. writer john grant forbes stated 1811, "the indians represent [the southern points] impenetrable; [british] surveyors, wreckers, coasters, means exploring beyond borders sea coast, mouths rivers".[3] british surveyor john gerard de brahm, mapped coast florida 1773, called area "river glades". marjory stoneman douglas linguist wallace mcmullen suggest cartographers substituted "ever" "river".[3][4] name "everglades" first appeared map 1823, although also spelled "ever glades" late 1851.[5] seminole call pa-hay-okee, meaning "grassy water."[4] region labeled "pa-hai-okee" american military map 1839, although earlier called "ever glades" throughout second seminole war.[3] 2007 survey geographers ary j. lamme raymond k. oldakowski found "glades" emerged distinct vernacular region florida. comprises interior areas southernmost gulf coast south florida, largely corresponding everglades itself. one sparsely populated areas state.[6] geology[edit] geology south florida, together warm, wet, subtropical climate, provides conditions well-suited large marshland ecosystem. layers porous permeable limestone create water-bearing rock soil affect climate, weather, hydrology south florida.[7] properties rock underneath everglades explained geologic history state. crust underneath florida one point part african region supercontinent gondwana. 300 millionyears ago, north america merged africa, connecting florida north america. volcanic activity centered eastern side florida covered prevalent sedimentary rock igneous rock. continental rifting began separate north america gondwana 180 millionyears ago.[8] florida part africa, initially water, cooler jurassic period, florida platform became shallow marine environment sedimentary rocks deposited. cretaceous period, florida remained tropical sea floor varying depths.[9] peninsula covered seawater least seven times since bedrock formed.[10] limestone aquifers[edit] fluctuating sea levels compressed numerous layers calcium carbonate, sand, shells. resulting permeable limestone formations developed 25million 70million years ago created floridan aquifer, serves main source fresh water northern portion florida. however, aquifer lies beneath thousands feet impermeable sedimentary rock lake okeechobee southern tip peninsula.[11] limestone formations south florida. source: u.s. geological survey five geologic formations make southern portion florida: tamiami formation, caloosahatchee formation, anastasia formation, miami limestone (or miami oolite), fort thompson formation. tamiami formation compression highly permeable light colored fossiliferous sands pockets quartz, 150 feet (46m) thick. named tamiami trail follows upper bedrock big cypress swamp, underlies southern portion everglades. tamiami formation lake okeechobee caloosahatchee formation, named river it. much less permeable, formation highly calcitic composed sandy shell marl, clay, sand. water underneath caloosahatchee formation typically mineralized. tamiami caloosahatchee formations developed pliocene epoch.[12][13] surrounding southern part lake okeechobee fort thompson formation, made dense, hard limestone, shells, sand. rain water less likely erode limestone form solution holes‚Äîsmaller versions sinkholes intersect water table. formation beds generally impermeable.[14] underneath metropolitan areas palm beach county anastasia formation, composed shelly limestone, coquina, sand representing former mangrove salt marsh. anastasia formation much permeable filled pocks solution holes.[14] fort thompson anastasia formations, miami limestone (x), formed sangamon interglacial period.[15] geologic formations influence everglades miami limestone fort thompson formation. miami limestone forms floor lower everglades. miami limestone made ooids: tiny formations egg-shaped concentric shells calcium carbonate, formed around single grain sand. miami limestone formerly named miami oolite, comprises facies ooids fossilized bryozoan organisms.[16] unique structure some first material used housing early 20th-century south florida. composition sedimentary formation affects hydrology, plant life, wildlife it: rock especially porous stores water dry season everglades, chemical composition determines vegetation prevalent region. miami limestone also acts dam fort lauderdale coot bay.[17] metropolitan areas miami, fort lauderdale, west palm beach located rise elevation along eastern coast florida, called eastern coastal ridge, formed waves compressed ooids single formation. along western border big cypress swamp immokolee ridge (or immokolee rise), slight rise compressed sand divides runoff caloosahatchee river big cypress.[18] slight rise elevation sides everglades creates basin, forces water overflows lake okeechobee creep toward southwest.[19] miami limestone formation fort thompson limestone lies biscayne aquifer, surface aquifer serves miami metropolitan area's fresh water source. rainfall stored water everglades replenish biscayne aquifer directly.[15] rise sea levels occurred pleistocene approximately 17,000years ago, runoff water lake okeechobee slowed created vast marshland known everglades. slower runoff also created accumulation almost 18 feet (5.5 m) peat area. presence peat deposits, dated 5,000years ago, evidence widespread flooding occurred then.[20] hydrology[edit] predevelopment flow direction water lake okeechobee florida bay source: u.s. geological survey consistent everglades flooding fed extensive kissimmee, caloosahatchee, myakka, peace rivers central florida. kissimmee river broad floodplain empties directly lake okeechobee, 730 square miles (1,900km2) average depth 9 feet (2.7m), vast shallow lake.[21] soil deposits everglades basin indicate peat deposited land flooded consistently throughout year. calcium deposits left behind flooding shorter. deposits occur areas water rises falls depending rainfall, opposed water stored rock one year next. calcium deposits present limestone exposed.[22] area orlando tip florida peninsula one point single drainage unit. rainfall exceeded capacity lake okeechobee kissimmee river floodplain, spilled flowed southwestern direction empty florida bay. prior urban agricultural development florida, everglades began southern edge lake okeechobee flowed approximately 100 miles (160km), emptying gulf mexico. limestone shelf wide slightly angled instead narrow, deep channel characteristic rivers. vertical gradient lake okeechobee florida bay 2 inches (5.1cm) per mile, creating almost 60-mile (97km) wide expanse river travels half mile (0.8km) day.[23] slow movement broad, shallow river known sheetflow, gives everglades nickname, river grass. water leaving lake okeechobee may require months years reach final destination, florida bay. sheetflow travels slowly water typically stored one wet season next porous limestone substrate. ebb flow water shaped land every ecosystem south florida throughout everglades' estimated 5,000years existence. motion water defines plant communities animals adapt habitats food sources.[24] climate[edit] hurricane charley 2004 moving ashore south florida's gulf mexico coast climate south florida located across broad transition zone subtropical tropical climates (koppen cf aw). like regions climate type, two basic seasons ‚Äì "dry season" (winter) runs november april, "wet season" (summer) runs may october. 70% annual rainfall south florida occurs wet season ‚Äì often brief intense tropical downpours. dry season sees little rainfall dew points humidity often quite low. dry season severe times, wildfires water restrictions often place. annual range temperatures south florida everglades rather small (less 20¬∞f [11¬∞c]) ‚Äì ranging monthly mean temperature around 65¬∞f (18¬∞c) january 83¬∞f (28¬∞c) july. high temperatures hot wet season (summer) typically exceed 90¬∞f (32¬∞c) across inland south florida (although coastal locations cooled winds gulf mexico atlantic ocean), high temperatures dry winter season average 70 79¬∞f (21 26¬∞c). frost freeze rare across south florida everglades; annually coastal cities like miami naples report zero days frost, although times decade low temperatures may fall 30 40¬∞f (‚àí1 4¬∞c) across south florida. annual rainfall averages approximately 62 inches (160cm), eastern coastal ridge receiving majority precipitation area surrounding lake okeechobee receiving 48 inches (120cm).[25] unlike other wetland system earth, everglades sustained primarily atmosphere.[26] evapotranspiration ‚Äì sum evaporation plant transpiration earth's land surface atmosphere ‚Äì associated thunderstorms, key mechanism water leaves region. year unaffected drought, rate may reach 40 inches (100cm) year. droughts take place, rate may peak 50 inches (130cm), exceed

evapotranspiration responsible approximately 70‚Äì90percent water entering undeveloped wetland regions everglades.[28] precipitation wet season primarily caused air mass thunderstorms easterly flow subtropical high (bermuda high). intense daytime heating ground causes warm moist tropical air rise, creating afternoon thundershowers typical tropical climates. 2:00pm mean time daily thundershowers across south florida everglades. late wet season (august september), precipitation levels reach highest levels tropical depressions lows add daily rainfall. occasionally, tropical lows become severe tropical cyclones cause significant damage make landfall across south florida. tropical storms average one year, major hurricanes every ten years. 1871 1981, 138tropical cyclones struck directly close everglades.[25] strong winds storms disperse plant seeds replenish mangrove forests, coral reefs, other ecosystems. dramatic fluctuations precipitation characteristic south florida climate. droughts, floods, tropical cyclones part natural water system everglades.[28] average, maximum, minimum levels rainfall lower east coast florida, 1918 1985[25] period mean maximum minimum annual 51.9 inches

sustaining processes[edit] main article: geography ecology everglades everglades complex system interdependent ecosystems. marjory stoneman douglas described area "river grass" 1947, though metaphor represents portion system. area recognized everglades, prior drainage, web marshes prairies 4,000 square miles (10,000km2) size.[29] borders ecosystems subtle imperceptible. systems shift, grow shrink, die, reappear within years decades. geologic factors, climate, frequency fire help create, maintain, replace ecosystems everglades. water[edit] storm shark river everglades, 1966 photo:charles barron / state library archives florida water dominant force everglades, shaping land, vegetation, animal life south florida. starting last glacial maximum, 21,000 years ago, continental ice sheets retreated sea levels rose. submerged portions florida peninsula caused water table rise. fresh water saturated limestone underlies everglades, eroding some away, created springs sinkholes. abundance fresh water allowed new vegetation take root, formed convective thunderstorms land evaporation.[30][31] rain continued fall, slightly acidic rainwater dissolved limestone. limestone wore away, groundwater came contact land surface created massive wetland ecosystem.[30] although region appears flat, weathering limestone created slight valleys plateaus some areas. plateaus rise fall inches, subtle south florida topography small variations affect flow water types vegetation take hold.[32] rock[edit] uneven limestone formations everglades sawgrass prairie underlying bedrock limestone everglades basin affects hydroperiod, long area within region stays flooded throughout year.[30] longer hydroperiods possible areas submerged beneath seawater longer periods time, geology florida forming. water held within porous ooids limestone older types rock spent time sea level.[33] hydroperiod ten months fosters growth sawgrass, whereas shorter hydroperiod six months less promotes beds periphyton, growth algae other microscopic organisms. two types soil everglades, peat marl. longer hydroperiods, peat builds hundreds thousands years due many generations decaying plant matter.[34] periphyton grows, soil develops marl, calcitic composition. initial attempts developing agriculture near lake okeechobee successful, nutrients peat rapidly removed. process called soil subsidence, oxidation peat causes loss volume.[35] bacteria decompose dead sawgrass slowly underwater without oxygen. water drained 1920s bacteria interacted oxygen, aerobic reaction occurred. microorganisms degraded peat carbon dioxide water. some peat burned settlers clear land. some homes built areas early farms foundations moved stilts peat deteriorated; other areas lost approximately 8 feet (2.4m) soil depth.[36] fire[edit] fire important element natural maintenance everglades. majority fires caused lightning strikes thunderstorms wet season. effects largely superficial, serve foster specific plant growth: sawgrass burn water, roots preserved underneath. fire sawgrass marshes serves keep larger bushes trees, releases nutrients decaying plant matter efficiently decomposition.[37] whereas wet season, dead plant matter tips grasses trees burned, dry season fire may fed organic peat burn deeply, destroying root systems.[37] fires confined existing water rainfall. takes approximately 225years one foot (.30 m) peat develop, some locations peat less dense 5,000years everglades' existence.[38] scientists indicate fire cause; also cited reason black color everglades muck. layers charcoal detected peat portions everglades indicate region endured severe fires years time, although trend seems abated since last occurrence 940 bce.[38] ecosystems[edit] main article: geography ecology everglades major landscape types everglades human action. source: u.s. geological survey sawgrass marshes sloughs[edit] several ecosystems present everglades, boundaries subtle absent. primary feature everglades sawgrass marsh. iconic water sawgrass combination shallow river 100 miles (160km) long 60 miles (97km) wide spans lake okeechobee florida bay often referred "true everglades" "the glades".[39][40] prior first drainage attempts 1905, sheetflow occupied nearly third lower florida peninsula.[30] sawgrass thrives slowly moving water, may die unusually deep floods oxygen unable reach roots. particularly vulnerable immediately fire.[41] hydroperiod marsh least nine months, last longer.[42] sawgrass grows densely, animals other plants live, although alligators choose locations nesting. room, periphyton grows.[43] periphyton supports larval insects amphibians, turn consumed food birds, fish, reptiles. also absorbs calcium water, adds calcitic composition marl.[44] sloughs, free-flowing channels water, develop sawgrass prairies. sloughs 3 feet (0.91m) deeper sawgrass marshes, may stay flooded least 11months year sometimes multiple years row.[45] aquatic animals turtles, alligators, snakes, fish thrive sloughs; usually feed aquatic invertebrates.[46] submerged floating plants grow here, bladderwort (utricularia), waterlily (nymphaeaceae), spatterdock (nuphar lutea). major sloughs everglades system include shark river slough flowing florida bay, lostmans river slough bordering big cypress, taylor slough eastern everglades. wet prairies slightly elevated like sawgrass marshes, greater plant diversity. surface covered water three seven months year, water is, average, shallow 4 inches (10cm) deep.[47] flooded, marl support variety water plants.[48] solution holes, deep pits limestone worn away, may remain flooded even prairies dry, support aquatic invertebrates crayfish snails, larval amphibians feed young wading birds.[49] regions tend border sloughs sawgrass marshes. alligators created niche wet prairies. claws snouts dig low spots create ponds free vegetation remain submerged throughout dry season. alligator holes integral survival aquatic invertebrates, turtles, fish, small mammals, birds extended drought periods. alligators feed upon some animals come hole.[50][51] tropical hardwood hammock[edit] tropical hardwood hammock, trees dense diverse. main article: tropical hardwood hammock small islands trees growing land raised 1 foot (0.30m) 3 feet (0.91m) sloughs prairies called tropical hardwood hammocks.[52] may range one (4,000m¬≤) ten acres (40,000m¬≤) area, appear freshwater sloughs, sawgrass prairies, pineland. hammocks slightly elevated limestone plateaus risen several inches surrounding peat, may grow land unharmed deep peat fires. hardwood hammocks exhibit mixture subtropical hardwood trees, southern live oak (quercus virginiana), gumbo limbo (bursera simaruba), royal palm (roystonea), bustic (dipholis salicifolia) grow dense clumps.[53] near base, sharp saw palmettos (serenoa repens) flourish, making hammocks difficult people penetrate, though small mammals, reptiles amphibians find islands ideal habitat. water sloughs flows around islands, creating moats. though some ecosystems maintained promoted fire, hammocks may take decades centuries recover. moats around hammocks protect trees.[54] trees limited height weather factors frost, lightning, wind; majority trees hammocks grow higher 55 feet (17m). pineland[edit] some driest land everglades pineland (also called pine rockland) ecosystem, located highest part everglades little hydroperiod. some floors, however, may flooded solution holes puddles months time. significant feature pineland single species south florida slash pine (pinus elliottii). pineland communities require fire maintain them, trees several adaptations simultaneously promote resist fire.[55] sandy floor pine forest covered dry pine needles highly flammable. south florida slash pines insulated bark protect heat. fire eliminates competing vegetation forest floor, opens pine cones germinate seeds.[56] period without significant fire turn pineland hardwood hammock larger trees overtake slash pines.[57] understory shrubs pine rocklands fire-resistant saw palmetto (serenoa repens), cabbage palm (sabal palmetto), west indian lilac (tetrazygia bicolor). diverse group plants pine community herbs, two dozen species. plants contain tubers other mechanisms allow sprout quickly charred.[58] prior urban development south florida region, pine rocklands covered approximately 161,660 acres (654.2km2) miami-dade county. within everglades national park, 19,840 acres (80.3km2) pine forests protected, outside park, 1,780 acres (7.2km2) pine communities remained 1990, averaging 12.1 acres (49,000m2) area.[55] misunderstanding role fire also played part disappearance pine forests area, natural fires put pine rocklands transitioned hardwood hammocks. prescribed fires occur everglades national park pine rocklands every three seven years.[59] cross section fresh water ecosystems everglades, relative average water depths cypress[edit] pond big cypress cypress swamps found throughout everglades, largest covers collier county. big cypress swamp located west sawgrass prairies sloughs, commonly called "the big cypress."[60] name refers area rather height diameter trees; conservative estimate, swamp measures 1,200 square miles (3,100km2), hydrologic boundary big cypress calculated 2,400 square miles (6,200km2).[61] big cypress sits atop bedrock covered thinner layer limestone. limestone underneath big cypress contains quartz, creates sandy soil hosts variety vegetation different found other areas everglades.[60] basin big cypress receives average 55 inches (140cm) water wet season.[62] though big cypress largest growth cypress swamps south florida, cypress swamps found near atlantic coastal ridge lake okeechobee eastern flatwoods, well sawgrass marshes. cypresses deciduous conifers uniquely adapted thrive flooded conditions, buttressed trunks root projections protrude water, called "knees".[63] bald cypress trees grow formations tallest thickest trunks center, rooted deepest peat. peat thins out, cypresses grow smaller thinner, giving small forest appearance dome outside.[64] also grow strands, slightly elevated ridge limestone bordered either side sloughs.[65] other hardwood trees found cypress domes, red maple, swamp bay, pop ash. cypresses removed, hardwoods take over, ecosystem recategorized mixed swamp forest. mangrove coastal prairie[edit] red mangrove trees bordering tidal estuary everglades eventually water lake okeechobee big cypress makes way ocean. mangrove trees well adapted transitional zone brackish water fresh salt water meet.[66] estuarine ecosystem ten thousand islands, comprised almost completely mangrove forests, covers almost 200,000 acres (810km2).[67] wet season fresh water pours florida bay, sawgrass begins grow closer coastline. dry season, particularly extended periods drought, salt water creeps inland coastal prairie, ecosystem buffers freshwater marshes absorbing sea water. mangrove trees begin grow fresh water ecosystems salt water goes far enough inland.[68] three species trees considered mangroves: red (rhizophora mangle), black (avicennia germinans), white (laguncularia racemosa), although different families.[69] grow oxygen-poor soil, survive drastic water level changes, tolerant salt, brackish, fresh water.[70] three mangrove species integral coastline protection severe storms. red mangroves farthest-reaching roots, trapping sediments help build coastlines storms. three types trees absorb energy waves storm surges. everglades mangroves also serve nurseries crustaceans fish, rookeries birds. region supports tortugas pink shrimp (farfantepenaeus duorarum) stone crab (menippe mercenaria) industries;[71] 80 90 percent commercially harvested crustacean species florida's salt waters born spend time near everglades.[67][72] florida bay[edit] main article: florida bay clump mangroves distance, florida bay flamingo much coast inner estuaries built mangroves; border coastal marshes bay. thus marine ecosystems florida bay considered part everglades watershed one ecosystems connected affected everglades whole. 800 square miles (2,100km2) florida bay protected everglades national park, representing largest body water park boundaries.[73] approximately 100 keys florida bay, many mangrove forests.[74] fresh water coming florida bay everglades creates perfect conditions vast beds turtle grass algae formations foundation animal life bay. sea turtles manatees eat grass, invertebrate animals, worms, clams other mollusks eat algae formations microscopic plankton.[75] female sea turtles return annually nest shore, manatees spend winter months warmer water bay. sea grasses also serve stabilize sea beds protect shorelines erosion absorbing energy waves. history[edit] native americans[edit] main article: indigenous people everglades region humans arrived florida peninsula approximately 15,000years ago. paleo-indians came florida probably following large game included giant sloths, saber-toothed cats, spectacled bears. found arid landscape supported plants animals adapted desert conditions.[76] however, 6,500years ago, climate changes brought wetter landscape; large animals became extinct florida, paleo-indians slowly adapted became archaic peoples. conformed environmental changes, created many tools various resources available.[77] late archaic period, climate became wetter again, approximately 3000 bce rise water tables allowed increase population cultural activity. florida indians developed three distinct similar cultures named bodies water near located: okeechobee, caloosahatchee, glades.[78] calusa tequesta[edit] main articles: calusa tequesta glades peoples, two major nations emerged area: calusa tequesta. calusa largest powerful nation south florida. controlled fifty villages located florida's west coast, around lake okeechobee, florida keys. calusa villages located mouths rivers key islands. calusa hunter-gatherers lived small game, fish, turtles, alligators, shellfish, various plants.[79] tools made bone teeth, although sharpened reeds also effective hunting war. calusa weapons consisted bows arrows, atlatls, spears. canoes used transportation, south florida tribes often canoed everglades, rarely lived them.[80] canoe trips cuba also common.[81] estimated numbers calusa beginning spanish occupation ranged 4,000 7,000.[82] society declined power population; 1697 number estimated 1,000.[81] early 18th century, calusa came attack yamasee north. asked spanish refuge cuba, almost 200 died illness. soon relocated florida keys.[83] second power number calusa south florida tequesta. occupied southeastern portion lower peninsula modern-day dade broward counties. like calusa, tequesta societies centered mouths rivers. main village probably miami river little river. spanish depictions tequesta state greatly feared sailors, suspected torturing killing survivors shipwrecks.[84] increasing european presence south florida, native americans keys other areas began increasing trips cuba. official permission immigration native americans florida keys granted cuban officials 1704.[85] spanish priests attempted set missions 1743, noted tequesta assault neighboring tribe. 30members left, removed havana. british surveyor 1770 described multiple deserted villages region tequesta lived.[86] common descriptions native americans florida 1820 used term "seminoles".[87] seminole[edit] main article: seminole seminoles made home everglades following demise calusa tequesta, native americans southern florida referred "spanish indians" 1740s, probably due friendlier relations spain. creek invaded florida peninsula; conquered assimilated left pre-columbian societies creek confederacy. joined remnant indian groups formed seminole, new tribe, ethnogenesis. seminole originally settled northern portion territory. addition, free blacks fugitive slaves made way florida, spain promised slaves freedom arms converted catholicism pledged loyalty spain. african americans gradually created communities near seminole, became known black seminoles. groups acted allies. 1817, andrew jackson invaded florida hasten annexation united states, became known first seminole war. florida became u.s. territory 1821, conflicts settlers seminole increased former tried

selling craftworks.[92] 2008, seminole tribe florida five reservations, lands miccosukee tribe indians collectively considered sixth reservation. two tribes developed casino gaming some properties generate revenue support, services economic development.[93] exploration[edit] map everglades 1856: military action seminole wars improved understanding features everglades main article: draining development everglades military penetration southern florida offered opportunity map poorly understood largely unknown part country. 1840 expedition everglades offered first printed account general public read everglades. anonymous writer described terrain party crossing: "no country ever heard bears resemblance it; seems like vast sea filled grass green trees, expressly intended retreat rascally indian, white man would never seek drive them".[94] land seemed inspire extreme reactions wonder hatred. second seminole war army surgeon wrote, "it fact hideous region live in, perfect paradise indians, alligators, serpents, frogs, every other kind loathsome reptile."[95] 1897, explorer hugh willoughby spent eight days canoeing party mouth harney river miami river. sent observations new orleans times-democrat. willoughby described water healthy wholesome, numerous springs, 10,000alligators "more less" lake okeechobee. party encountered thousands birds near shark river, "killing hundreds, continued return".[96] willoughby pointed much rest country explored mapped except part florida, writing, "(w)e tract land one hundred thirty miles long seventy miles wide much unknown white man heart africa."[97] drainage[edit] national push expansion progress united states occurred later part 19th century, stimulated interest draining everglades agricultural use. according historians, "from middle nineteenth century middle twentieth century, united states went period wetland removal questioned. indeed, considered proper thing do."[98] draining everglades suggested early 1837,[5] resolution congress passed 1842 prompted secretary treasury robert j. walker request experience everglades give opinion possibility drainage. many officers served seminole wars favored idea.[5] 1850 congress passed law gave several states wetlands within state boundaries. swamp overflowed lands act ensured state would responsible funding attempts developing wetlands farmlands.[99] florida quickly formed committee consolidate grants pay attempts, though civil war reconstruction halted progress 1877. hamilton disston's land sale notice civil war, state agency called internal improvement fund (iif), whose purpose improve florida's roads, canals, rail lines, discovered deeply debt. iif found pennsylvania real estate developer named hamilton disston interested implementing plans drain land agriculture. disston purchased 4,000,000 acres (16,000km2) land $1 million 1881,[100] began constructing canals near st. cloud. first canals seemed work lowering water levels wetlands surrounding rivers.[101] effective lowering groundwater, became apparent capacity insufficient wet season.[102] though disston's canals drain well, purchase primed economy florida. made news attracted tourists land buyers. within four years property values doubled, population increased significantly.[100] iif able invest development projects due disston's purchase, opportunity improve transportation arose oil tycoon henry flagler began purchasing land building rail lines along east coast florida, far south palm beach 1893.[103] along way built resort hotels, transforming territorial outposts tourist destinations. land bordering rail lines developed citrus farms.[104] 1896 rail line extended biscayne bay.[105] three months first train arrived, residents miami voted incorporate town. miami became prime destination extremely wealthy people royal palm hotel opened.[106] 1904 gubernatorial race, strongest candidate, napoleon bonaparte broward, promoted draining everglades. called future south florida "empire everglades". soon successful election, began work "drain abominable pestilence-ridden swamp",[107] pushed florida legislature form group commissioners oversee reclamation flooded lands. 1907 established everglades drainage district began study build effective canals, fund them.[5] governor broward ran u.s. senate 1908 lost. broward paid land developer richard j. bolles tour state promote drainage. elected senate 1910, broward died could take office. land everglades sold $15 acre month broward died.[108] meanwhile, henry flagler continued build railway stations towns soon populations warranted them.[105] growth urban areas[edit] canal lock everglades drainage district around 1915 construction canals, newly reclaimed everglades land promoted throughout united states. land developers sold 20,000lots months 1912. advertisements promised within eight weeks arrival, farmer could making living, although many took least two months clear land. some tried burning sawgrass other vegetation, learn peat continued burn. animals tractors used plowing got mired muck useless. muck dried, turned fine black powder created dust storms.[109] though initially crops sprouted quickly lushly, quickly wilted died, seemingly without reason.[110] increasing population towns near everglades hunted area. raccoons otters widely hunted skins. hunting often went unchecked; one trip, lake okeechobee hunter killed 250alligators 172otters.[111] water birds particular target plume hunting. bird feathers used women's hats late 19th early 20th centuries. 1886, 5million birds estimated killed feathers.[112] shot usually spring, feathers colored mating nesting. plumes, aigrettes, called millinery business, sold $32 ounce 1915‚Äî price gold.[111] millinery $17million year industry[113] motivated plume harvesters lay watch nests egrets many colored birds nesting season, shoot parents small-bore rifles, leave chicks starve.[111] plumes everglades wading birds could found havana, new york city, london, paris. hunters could collect plumes hundred birds good day.[114] rum-runners used everglades hiding spot prohibition; vast never enough law enforcement officers patrol it.[115] arrival railroad, discovery adding trace elements like copper remedy crops sprouting dying quickly, soon created population boom. new towns moore haven, clewiston, belle glade sprouted like crops.[5] sugarcane became primary crop grown south florida. miami experienced second real estate boom earned developer coral gables $150million. undeveloped land north miami sold $30,600 acre.[116] 1925, miami newspapers published editions weighing 7 pounds (3.2kg), real estate advertising.[117] waterfront property highly valued. mangrove trees cut replaced palm trees improve view. acres south florida slash pine cleared. some pine lumber, pine forests dade county cleared development.[55] flood control[edit] sign advertising completion herbert hoover dike two catastrophic hurricanes 1926 1928 caused lake okeechobee breach levees, killing thousands people. government began focus control floods rather drainage. okeechobee flood control district created 1929, financed state federal funds. president herbert hoover toured towns affected 1928 okeechobee hurricane ordered army corps engineers assist communities surrounding lake.[118] 1930 1937 dike 66 miles (106km) long built around southern edge lake. control hoover dike waters lake okeechobee delegated federal powers: united states declared legal limits lake 14 17 feet (4.3 5.2m).[97] massive canal also constructed 80 feet (24m) wide 6 feet (1.8m) deep caloosahatchee river; whenever lake rose high, excess water left canal.[97] $20million spent entire project. sugarcane production soared dike canal built. populations small towns surrounding lake jumped 3,000 9,000 world war ii.[119] immediately effects hoover dike seen. extended drought occurred 1930s; wall preventing water leaving lake okeechobee canals ditches removing other water, everglades became parched. peat turned dust. salt ocean water intruded miami's wells; city brought expert explain why, discovered water everglades area's groundwater‚Äîhere, appeared surface.[120] 1939, million acres (4,000km¬≤) everglades burned, black clouds peat sawgrass fires hung miami.[121] scientists took soil samples draining take account organic composition peat muck everglades make prone soil subsidence becomes dry. naturally occurring bacteria everglades peat muck assist process decomposition water, generally slow, partially due low levels dissolved oxygen. water levels became low peat muck surface, bacteria interacted much higher levels oxygen air, rapidly breaking soil. some places, homes moved stilts 8 feet (2.4m) soil lost.[36] everglades national park[edit] president harry truman dedicating everglades national park december 6, 1947. main article: everglades national park idea national park everglades pitched 1928, miami land developer named ernest f. coe established everglades tropical national park association. enough support declared national park congress 1934. took another 13years dedicated december 6, 1947.[122] one month dedication park, former editor miami herald freelance writer named marjory stoneman douglas released first book titled everglades: river grass. researching region five years, described history ecology south florida great detail. characterized everglades river instead stagnant swamp.[123] last chapter titled, "the eleventh hour" warned everglades dying, although could reversed.[124] central southern florida flood control project[edit] year park dedicated, two hurricanes wet season caused 100 inches (250cm) fall south florida. though human casualties, agricultural interests lost approximately $59million.[125] 1948 congress approved central southern florida project flood control other purposes (csf), divided everglades basins. northern everglades water conservation areas (wcas), everglades agricultural area (eaa) bordering south lake okeechobee. southern everglades everglades national park. levees pumping stations bordered wca, released water dryer times removed pumped ocean times flood. wcas took approximately 37percent original everglades.[126] csf constructed 1,000 miles (1,600km) canals, hundreds pumping stations levees within three decades. 1950s 1960s miami metropolitan area grew four times fast rest nation. 1940 1965, 6million people moved south florida: 1,000people moved miami every week.[127] developed areas mid-1950s late 1960s quadrupled. much water reclaimed everglades sent newly developed areas.[128] everglades agricultural area[edit] see also: draining_and_development_of_the_everglades ¬ßeverglades_agricultural_area 2003 u.s. geological survey photo

exotic plants take hold everglades.[132] one defining characteristics natural everglades ecology ability support nutrient-poor environment, introduction fertilizers began alter plant life region.[133] jetport proposition[edit] turning point came development everglades proposition expanded airport miami international airport outgrew capacities. new jetport planned larger o'hare, dulles, jfk, lax airports combined, chosen location 6 miles (9.7km) north everglades national park. first sentence u.s. department interior study environmental impact jetport read, "development proposed jetport attendant facilities... inexorably destroy south florida ecosystem thus everglades national park".[134] studies indicated proposed jetport would create 4,000,000 us gallons (15,000,000l) raw sewage day 10,000 short tons (9,100t) jet engine pollutants year, project met staunch opposition. new york times called "blueprint disaster",[135] wisconsin senator gaylord nelson wrote president richard nixon voicing opposition: "it test whether really committed country protecting environment."[136] governor claude kirk withdrew support project, marjory stoneman douglas persuaded 79years old go tour give hundreds speeches it. nixon instead established big cypress national preserve, announcing special message congress outlining 1972 environmental program .[137] restoration[edit] main article: restoration everglades kissimmee river[edit] central southern florida flood control project's final construction project straightening kissimmee river, meandering 90-mile (140km)-long river drained make way grazing land agriculture. csf started building c-38 canal 1962 effects seen almost immediately. waterfowl, wading birds, fish disappeared, prompting conservationists sport fishers demand region restored canal finished 1971.[138] general, csf projects criticized temporary fixes ignored future consequences, costing billions dollars end sight.[139] governor bob graham initiated save everglades campaign 1983, first section canal backfilled 1986. graham announced 2000 everglades would restored closely possible pre-drainage state.[140] kissimmee river restoration project approved congress 1992. estimated cost $578million convert 22 miles (35km) canal. entire project complete 2011,[141] yet 2017, project "more halfway complete" new completion date 2020. [142] water quality[edit] warnings placed everglades national park dissuade people eating fish due high mercury content. problems environment arose vast algal bloom appeared one-fifth lake okeechobee 1986. year cattails discovered overtaking sawgrass marshes loxahatchee national wildlife refuge. scientists discovered phosphorus, used fertilizer eaa, flushed canals pumped back lake.[143] lake drained, phosphorus entered water marshes, changing nutrient levels. kept periphyton forming marl, one two soils everglades. arrival phosphorus allowed cattails spread quickly. cattails grew dense mats‚Äîtoo thick birds alligators nest in. also dissolved oxygen peat, promoted algae, prohibited growth native invertebrates bottom food chain.[144] time mercury found local fish high levels consumption warnings posted fishermen. florida panther found dead levels mercury high enough kill human.[145] scientists found power plants incinerators using fossil fuels expelling mercury atmosphere, fell rain dust droughts. naturally occurring bacteria reduce sulfur everglades ecosystem transforming mercury methylmercury, bioaccumulating food chain.[145] stricter emissions standards helped lower mercury coming power plants incinerators, turn lowered mercury levels found animals, though continue concern.[145] everglades forever act, introduced governor lawton chiles 1994, attempt legislate lowering phosphorus everglades waterways. act put south florida water management district (sfwmd) florida department environmental protection (dep) charge testing enforcing low phosphorus levels: 10parts per billion (ppb) (down 500ppb 1980s).[146] sfwmd built stormwater treatment areas (stas) near sugarcane fields water leaving eaa flows ponds lined lime rock layers peat calcareous periphyton. testing shown method effective previously anticipated, bringing levels 80ppb 10ppb.[147] invasive species[edit] main article: list invasive species everglades climbing ferns overtake cypress trees everglades. ferns act "fire ladders" destroy trees would otherwise survive fires. center trade travel u.s., caribbean, south america, south florida especially vulnerable invasive species, species plants animals adapt aggressively conditions everglades, allowing reproduce faster grow larger would naturally native environments. approximately 26% species fish, reptiles, birds, mammals south florida exotic‚Äîmore other part u.s.‚Äîand region hosts one highest numbers exotic plant species world.[148] controlling invasive species 1,700,000 acres (6,900km2) infested land south florida costs authorities $500 million year.[149] everglades hosts 1,392 exotic plant species actively reproducing region, outnumbering 1,301 species considered native south florida.[150] melaleuca tree (melaleuca quinquenervia) takes water greater amounts other trees. melaleucas grow taller densely everglades native australia, making unsuitable nesting areas birds wide wingspans.[151] also choke native vegetation. $2million spent keeping everglades national park.[152] brazilian pepper, florida holly (schinus terebinthifolius), also wreaked havoc everglades, exhibiting tendency spread rapidly crowd native species plants well create inhospitable environments native animals. especially difficult eradicate readily propagated birds, eat small red berries.[153] brazilian pepper problem exclusive everglades;
