From today's featured article








Everglades National Park is a U.S. National Park in Florida that protects the southern 20percent of the original Everglades. It is the largest tropical wilderness in the United States and the third-largest national park in the lower 48states after Death Valley and Yellowstone. The park was established in 1934 when canal-building projects in South Florida were threatening the quickly vanishing Everglades, a network of wetlands and forests fed by a river flowing out of Lake Okeechobee into Florida Bay. It was the first national park created to protect a fragile ecosystem. The park is the most significant breeding ground for tropical wading birds in North America and contains the largest mangrove ecosystem in the western hemisphere. It is home to 36threatened or protected species including the Florida panther, the American crocodile, and the West Indian manatee, and supports 350species of birds, 300species of fresh and saltwater fish, 40species of mammals, and 50species of reptiles. Most of South Florida's fresh water comes from the Biscayne Aquifer, which is replenished by the Everglades. (Fullarticle...)
