From today's featured article








Villa Park is an association football stadium in Aston, Birmingham, England, with a seating capacity of 42,682. Formerly a sports ground in a Victorian amusement park, it has been the home of Aston Villa Football Club since 17 April 1897. The ground has hosted sixteen England internationals at senior level, the first in 1899 and the most recent in 2005. It has hosted 55 FA Cup semi-finals, more than any other stadium. The club has initial planning permission to redevelop its North Stand, which will increase its capacity to around 50,000. Aside from football-related uses, the stadium has seen concerts and other sporting events, including boxing matches and international rugby league and rugby union matches. In 1999, the last ever final of the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup took place at Villa Park. It also hosted the 2012 FA Community Shield, as Wembley Stadium was being used for the final of the Olympic football tournament. (Fullarticle...)

The band's current lineup (left to right):
Andrew Stockdale, Ian Peres and Alex Carapetis


The discography of Australian hard rock band Wolfmother consists of four studio albums, four extended plays (EPs), eleven singles, twelve music videos and one video album. The band have also contributed to two soundtracks and one tribute album. Wolfmother were formed in 2000 by vocalist and guitarist Andrew Stockdale, bassist and keyboardist Chris Ross, and drummer Myles Heskett. After signing with Modular Recordings and releasing their self-titled debut EP in 2004, the band's debut full-length studio album, also titled Wolfmother, was released in Australia in 2005 and reached number three on the Australian Albums Chart. The album was released internationally the following year, selling over 1.5 million copies worldwide by 2009. In August 2008, Ross and Heskett left the band due to "irreconcilable personal and musical differences". Wolfmother returned in early 2010 with a new lineup featuring bassist and keyboardist Ian Peres, rhythm guitarist Aidan Nemeth and drummer Dave Atkins. The follow-up to Wolfmother, Cosmic Egg was released in October 2009, again reaching number three in Australia. (Fulllist...)
