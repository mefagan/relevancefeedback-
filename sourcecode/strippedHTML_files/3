From today's featured article








Noel Park in north London is a planned community designed by Rowland Plumbe in the late 19th century, consisting of 2,200 model dwellings. It was developed in open countryside to the north of London between the historic villages of Highgate and Tottenham by the Artizans, Labourers  General Dwellings Company. One of the earliest garden suburbs in the world, it provided affordable housing for working-class families wishing to leave the inner city. Every property had a front and rear garden, and it was close enough to the rail network to allow its residents to commute to work. In line with the principles of the company's founder, William Austin, it had no pubs, and there are still none today. As a result of London's rapid expansion during the early 20th century, and particularly after the London Underground was extended to the area in 1932, Noel Park was surrounded by later developments. In 1965, it was incorporated into the newly created London Borough of Haringey. Despite damage during World War II and demolition work during the construction of Wood Green Shopping City in the 1970s, it remains largely architecturally intact. (Fullarticle...)

Shannen Doherty


American actress Shannen Doherty has appeared in numerous television programs and motion pictures. Landing her first major role in the dramatic western television series Little House on the Prairie, Doherty had her breakthrough role as Brenda Walsh in the teen drama Beverly Hills, 90210. She was later removed from the series due to backstage issues. She starred in television films in the early and mid-1990s in an attempt to rebuild her career. Doherty enjoyed a resurgence in popularity while playing the witch Prue Halliwell on the supernatural drama Charmed. Following disagreements with Spelling and co-star Alyssa Milano, Doherty left the series in its third season. While acting in a string of television films, Doherty has also participated in five reality television shows. (Fulllist...)
